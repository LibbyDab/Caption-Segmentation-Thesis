The barn owl is unquestionably
a beautiful bird.

2
It has
a distinctive heart-shaped face,

3
mottled brown and grey wings
with pure white underparts.

4
They have a wingspan
of around 80-95 cm and weigh in

5
at 250-350g.

6
It is considered to be one
of Britain's most popular birds

7
and one of the more
commonly seen owls

8
due to its readiness to hunt
during the day,

9
although dusk is probably
the best time to see one.

10
They are silent hunters,
tiny serrations

11
on the leading edges of their
flight feathers

12
and a hairlike fringe
on the trailing edges

13
help to break up the flow of air
over the wings and this reduces

14
turbulence and the noise
it would cause.

15
The barn owl flies slowly
while hunting and will hover

16
over spots
where prey might be hiding.

17
The barn owl has
fantastic hearing

18
with asymmetrical ears
which improves the owl's ability

19
to pinpoint the position
and distance of sounds.

20
Their heart-shaped face
also aids the owl's ability

21
to hear.

22
It's been shown
that if the ruff feathers

23
are removed,
the owl can still determine

24
the sounds position,
but not its height.

25
Barn owls' main source of prey
are rodents

26
and other small mammals,
in fact,

27
over 90% of an owl's diet
is made up of such animals.

28
But it will also prey
upon other birds, lizards,

29
amphibians, fish, spiders,
and insects.

30
The barn owl has
a high metabolic rate,

31
more so than most other owls
of a similar size.

32
This means it requires
relatively more food.

33
Observations have shown
that the barn owl will eat

34
around 14% of its own body
weight of rodents per night.

35
It may also store excess food
at roosting sites which it

36
will return to if food is
scarce.

37
Their high rate of rodent kills
makes them very valuable

38
to farmers who
wish to keep the rodent

39
population down.

40
Barn owls
are said to be more effective

41
than poison for rodent control.

42
As their name suggests,
barn owls will nest

43
in cavities of barns
and old buildings as well

44
as hollows of trees.

45
Nests are built on top
of the previous year's nests.

46
There is no set breeding season
for these owls,

47
and this largely depends
on the available food supply,

48
but most commonly occurs
between March and August.

49
Around 4-6 eggs will be laid
and up to 2 broods

50
will be raised in a year.

51
Barn owls are fairly common
and be seen all over Britain

52
and Ireland,
although populations are

53
under threat in Northern
Ireland.

54
They did
go through a dramatic population

55
decline all over Britain
during the 1950s and 60s,

56
dipping down to as low as 4000
breeding pairs.

57
This was most likely
due to the use of toxic farm

58
chemicals such as DDT,
but also

59
loss of hunting habitat,
and two

60
particularly harsh winters
of 1946/47 and 1962/63.

61
Barn owls can also be
susceptible to poisoning

62
by ingesting rodents killed
by rodenticides.

63
Nesting sites are also scarce
due to many old barns

64
and buildings being demolished
or renovated.

65
Luckily,
population numbers

66
are thought to be on the rise
due to improved conservation

67
efforts and many nest boxes
being built.

68
These nest boxes have
also allowed populations of owls

69
to inhabit areas that they
previously were absent from,

70
such as the fens.

71
Although it seems the population
is fairly healthy,

72
having increased
to around 14,000 breeding pairs,

73
it is acknowledged
that monitoring

74
of nocturnal birds is difficult
and population studies are

75
somewhat unreliable.

76
Barn owls have
a typical lifespan of around 4

77
years,
typically breeding at 1 year.

78
However,
the oldest confirmed age

79
by the British Trust
for Ornithology, was 15 years,

80
3 months, and 21 days.

81
The barn owl is clearly
a beautiful bird,

82
easy on the eyes you might say,
but not so easy on the ears.

83
Other names for this bird
include' screech owl,

84
and' demon owl'
which might give you some idea

85
as to what they sound like!

86
But this is the'
beautiful birds' series,

87
not' beautiful sounding birds'
series,

88
so its place is well deserved.
