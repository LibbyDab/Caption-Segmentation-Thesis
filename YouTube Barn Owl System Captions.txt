The barn owl is unquestionably
a beautiful bird.

2
It has
a distinctive heart-shaped face,

3
mottled brown and grey wings
with pure white underparts.

4
They have
a wingspan of around 80-95 cm

5
and weigh in at 250-350g.

6
It is considered to be one
of Britain's most popular birds

7
and one of the more
commonly seen owls

8
due to its readiness to hunt
during the day,

9
although dusk
is probably the best time

10
to see one.

11
They are silent hunters,
tiny serrations

12
on the leading edges
of their flight feathers

13
and a hairlike fringe
on the trailing edges

14
help to break up the flow of air
over the wings and this reduces

15
turbulence and the noise
it would cause.

16
The barn owl
flies slowly while hunting

17
and will hover over spots
where prey might be hiding.

18
The barn owl has
fantastic hearing

19
with asymmetrical ears
which improves the owl's ability

20
to pinpoint
the position and distance

21
of sounds.

22
Their heart-shaped face
also aids

23
the owl's ability to hear.

24
It's been shown
that if the ruff feathers

25
are removed,
the owl can still determine

26
the sounds position,
but not its height.

27
Barn owls' main source of prey
are

28
rodents and other small mammals,
in fact,

29
over 90% of an owl's diet
is made up of such animals.

30
But it
will also prey upon other birds,

31
lizards, amphibians, fish,
spiders, and insects.

32
The barn owl
has a high metabolic rate,

33
more so than most other owls
of a similar size.

34
This means it
requires relatively more food.

35
Observations have shown
that the barn owl

36
will eat around 14%
of its own body weight

37
of rodents per night.

38
It may also store excess food
at roosting sites which it

39
will return
to if food is scarce.

40
Their high rate of rodent kills
makes them very valuable

41
to farmers who wish to keep
the rodent population down.

42
Barn owls
are said to be more effective

43
than poison for rodent control.

44
As their name suggests,
barn owls will nest in cavities

45
of barns and old buildings
as well as hollows of trees.

46
Nests are built on top
of the previous year's nests.

47
There is no set breeding season
for these owls,

48
and this largely depends
on the available food supply,

49
but most commonly occurs
between March and August.

50
Around 4-6 eggs
will be laid and up to 2 broods

51
will be raised in a year.

52
Barn owls are fairly common
and be seen all

53
over Britain and Ireland,
although populations are

54
under threat
in Northern Ireland.

55
They did go
through a dramatic population

56
decline all over Britain
during the 1950s and 60s,

57
dipping down
to as low as 4000 breeding

58
pairs.

59
This was most likely
due to the use

60
of toxic farm chemicals
such as DDT,

61
but also
loss of hunting habitat,

62
and two
particularly harsh winters

63
of 1946/47 and 1962/63.

64
Barn owls can also be
susceptible to poisoning

65
by ingesting rodents
killed by rodenticides.

66
Nesting sites are also scarce
due to many old barns

67
and buildings
being demolished or renovated.

68
Luckily,
population numbers

69
are thought to be on the rise
due to improved conservation

70
efforts
and many nest boxes being built.

71
These nest boxes
have also allowed

72
populations of owls
to inhabit areas that they

73
previously were absent from,
such as the fens.

74
Although it seems the population
is fairly healthy,

75
having increased
to around 14,000 breeding pairs,

76
it is acknowledged
that monitoring

77
of nocturnal birds is difficult
and population studies

78
are somewhat unreliable.

79
Barn owls have
a typical lifespan

80
of around 4 years,
typically breeding at 1 year.

81
However,
the oldest confirmed age

82
by the British Trust
for Ornithology,

83
was 15 years, 3 months,
and 21 days.

84
The barn owl
is clearly a beautiful bird,

85
easy on the eyes you might say,
but not so easy on the ears.

86
Other names for this bird
include' screech owl,

87
and' demon owl'
which might give you some idea

88
as to what they sound like!

89
But this is
the' beautiful birds' series,

90
not' beautiful
sounding birds' series,

91
so its place is well deserved.
