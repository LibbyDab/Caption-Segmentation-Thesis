As Julia Child 14
once said 9
with enough butter anything 27
is good, 8
and that is 11
especially true 15
with fresh butter, 18
and so today I 14
am 2
going 5
to hand churn some fresh butter. 32
So thank you 12
to Squarespace 14
for sponsoring this video 25
as I dive in to butter 22
this time on Tasting History. 29
So I've 7
been 4
searching 9
for an actual historic recipe 29
for making butter 17
but they're 11
really hard 11
to find 7
because it 10
seems 5
like throughout most of history 31
people 6
just knew 9
how to make butter so nobody 28
really wrote it down. 21
It would just say make butter, 30
but I 5
found 5
some partial instructions 25
in my favorite 17th century 27
cookbook' 9
The Closet 10
of the Eminently Learned Sir 28
Kenelme Digbie Opened' 22
and as if the name 18
of the cookbook 15
isn't fancy enough the name 27
of the recipe sure is. 22
" My lord 9
of Saint Alban's Creme Fouette. 31
Put as much 11
as you please to make, 22
of thick cream into a dish, 27
and whip 8
it 2
with a bundle 13
of white hard rushes, 21
-LRB- 5
of such 7
as they 7
make whisks to brush cloaks 27
-RRB- tied together, 20
till it come to be very thick, 30
and near a buttery substance. 29
If you whip it too long, 24
it will become butter ... 25
" 1
So in his 9
trying 6
to tell you how not to make 27
butter he 9
inadvertently tells you 23
how to make butter, 19
and that's 10
really all that butter is, 26
it's 4
whipped cream 13
that got 8
whipped 7
too much 8
until all the buttermilk 24
fell out. 9
But there 9
are 3
a few more steps 16
in making a proper butter. 26
Now there are many, 19
many types of butter 20
and one of the big delineators 30
is the fat content. 19
You 3
really need at least 36% fat 28
but if you 10
can 3
find one 8
with 40% fat 12
or even more all the better. 28
Also here in America 20
most of our milk and cream 26
is 2
pasteurized 11
which makes it 14
so the flavor 13
is just a little bit more bland, 32
so if you 9
can 3
find 4
raw cream 9
that is 7
going to make the best butter. 30
Also try 8
to find 7
cream 5
that has 8
come from grass - fed cows 26
because it 10
is 2
going 5
to have 7
more beta - carotene in it 26
which is 8
going 5
to lead to a more yellow butter 31
rather than the pale white 26
butter 6
that you'll often find at stores 32
. 1
Then the only other thing 25
that you'll need 16
is some way to churn it. 24
Now you 7
can 3
go 2
the really old - fashioned way 30
and use 7
a plunger style butter churn, 29
and it 6
will take you all afternoon, 28
or you 6
could 5
also use 8
a stand mixer 13
which will 10
take you 8
all of five minutes very modern 31
but kind of achieves 20
the same thing, 15
but I 5
am going to split the difference 32
and use 7
use 3
one of these hand cranked jars, 31
butter churns. 14
These were 10
very popular 12
in the 19th century, 20
it 2
was 3
a way 5
to make less amount of butter 29
so you're 9
not making a huge 17
churn of butter, 16
and it takes all of 15 minutes. 31
And I'll 8
put a link in the description 29
to where 8
you can get one of these. 25
So first let your cream 23
come to room temperature 24
and then pour it into the jar 29
and screw the lid on, 21
and get to churning. 20
And it 6
really helps 12
to pass the time 16
if you 6
have a good churning song 25
like The Byrds â ™ ª 20
this is my butter churn, churn, 31
churn. 6
â ™ ª 5
But regardless of your chosen 29
soundtrack 10
after seven or eight minutes you 32
should 6
have 4
something 9
similar to whipped cream, 25
and that means 14
that you 8
are about halfway there, 24
so continue 11
to churn 8
the whipped cream 17
for about one more song. 24
â ™ ª Churn the cream around, 29
love to make that butter. 25
â ™ ª 5
And then almost in an instant 29
it 2
will 4
become 6
very difficult to churn anymore, 32
and that is 11
when 4
the buttermilk 14
separates from the fat, 23
the fat being the butter. 25
Pour out as much buttermilk 27
as you 6
possibly can 12
and then put the butter 23
into a bowl. 12
Now the goal 12
here is 7
to remove as much buttermilk 28
from the butter as possible, 28
and it will make it last longer. 32
So the first way to do that is 30
to wash the butter. 19
So pour very cold water 23
over the butter 15
and knead the butter 20
while the water gets all murky. 31
And it 6
is really important 19
that it 7
is 2
ice 3
cold water or else the butter 29
will just melt. 15
Then remove that water 22
and repeat 10
the process with clean water 28
for three or four times, 24
or until the water 18
remains fairly clear 20
even as you rinse it. 21
Then dry the butter 19
in some tightly woven 21
cheesecloth, 12
wringing out as much liquid 27
as possible. 12
And again it's really important 31
that it's 9
very cold 9
butter or else it 17
just melts and goes 19
through the cheesecloth, 24
and it 6
turns out 9
August 6
in my house not the best weather 32
for making butter, 18
so I 4
ended up 8
having 6
to put it into the refrigerator 31
several times 13
just to make it manageable, 27
and even then after like 24
10 seconds of working with it it 32
would start to melt. 20
Yeah, 5
make this during the winter. 28
The next step 13
in getting 10
even more buttermilk out 24
is with paddles. 16
Basically you're 16
going 5
to squeeze the butter 21
together as more liquid 23
comes out 9
and you 7
can use your hands for this, 28
but again your hands 20
will make it melt. 18
Even with the paddles mine 26
was melted, 11
made an absolute mess. 22
If it's cold it 15
doesn't make that mess. 23
Either way 10
push it 7
into any shape that you like 28
and it's ready to eat. 22
Now this is 11
historically what 17
is 2
called 6
sweet butter or fresh butter 28
and it's ready to eat. 22
The problem 11
is 2
it 2
really doesn't last very long, 30
four or five days tops 22
before it starts to go rancid. 30
That's 6
why 3
throughout most of history salt 31
was added to the butter 23
and it was added at this stage, 31
but for most of history 23
it's 4
not like salted butter today 28
where 5
they add you know a little bit, 31
just give it some flavor. 25
They would add a ton of salt, 29
about 10 times the salt 23
that is 7
added today 11
to be used as a preservative, 29
thereby making 14
it rather unpalatable. 22
So when 7
you 3
did 3
want 4
to eat that super salted butter 31
you 3
would 5
have 4
to follow 9
in instructions 15
like these from the 14th century 32
' 1
Le MÃ © nagier de 17
Paris' " To desalt butter, 26
put it in a bowl on the fire 28
to melt, 8
and the salt 12
will 4
fall to the bottom of the bowl, 31
This salt is good in potage. 28
The remainder of the butter 27
stays sweet. 12
Otherwise, 10
put your salted butter 22
into fresh water, 17
knead it and pound it, 22
and the salt 12
will stay in the water . " 26
I'm 3
not adding enough salt 22
to my butter to preserve it 27
but I 5
might 5
add 3
just a little bit for flavoring 31
but before I 12
do 2
that let's 10
talk 4
about the history 17
of this most important 22
ingredient. 11
Butter 6
has been around for a long time 31
and while we 12
don't know 10
exactly how it was invented 27
there are some theories. 24
One 3
is 2
that somewhere in Central Asia 30
some cream 10
was 3
put 3
into a container of some sort 29
and kept on the saddle 22
and while galloping along it 28
churned the cream into butter. 30
But instead of butter from a cow 32
it 2
was 3
more likely 11
that it 7
was 3
butter from a yak or a camel, 29
both of which are 17
still made today. 17
Further north reindeer milk 27
was 3
also common 11
and supposedly great 20
for making butter, 18
for while reindeer 18
don't give much milk 20
it's 4
incredibly high 15
in fat making 13
for the best butter. 20
Now the earliest images we have 31
of people churning butter 25
comes 5
from the Sumerian city of Ur. 29
It 2
shows 5
two men 7
rocking a clay urn 18
back and forth to churn 23
the butter, 11
a process 9
still used 10
in some parts 13
of the world today. 19
From there butter 17
diverged 8
mostly in how it was preserved. 31
The first 9
and frankly more delicious way 30
was to melt the butter, 23
and let the liquid separate rate 32
from the milk solids. 21
Those milk solids 17
then would 10
go rancid less quickly, 23
and that is called ghee. 24
This method 11
was 3
and is 6
used today 10
in India 8
as well as much 15
of the Middle East and Africa, 30
and not only is it 18
great for cooking 17
but in its purest form it 25
is 2
used in oil lamps 17
or offered to Lord Krishna. 27
Now the other way 17
to preserve butter 18
was 3
as I 4
mentioned adding a lot of salt 30
and that's 10
the way 7
that most people 16
in the northern climates 24
of Asia and Europe did it, 26
and the Greeks and Romans 25
talked about people 19
from those areas 16
eating a lot of butter. 23
The Greek poet Anaxandrides 27
going 5
so far as to dub 16
the population 14
of Thrace baoutyrophagoi, 25
or butter eaters. 17
And Pliny 9
the Elder 9
say 3
that butter 11
is " 4
Held 4
as the choicest food 20
among barbarian tribes, 23
and one 7
which distinguishes the wealthy 31
from the multitude at large ... 31
the more rank it is in smell, 29
the more highly it is esteemed. 31
" 1
Now this rank or rancid butter 30
wasn't really for eating 24
but rather for for washing. 27
The physician Galen 19
said 4
that " 6
People in many cold regions 27
where they lack olive oil 25
use butter 10
for washing themselves . " 26
And those living north 22
of the Roman Empire 19
were 4
known to slick 14
back their hair 15
with this rancid butter 23
similar to pomade. 18
When 4
visiting 8
the Burgundian Court 20
in the 4th Century Bishop 25
Sidonis Apollinaris 19
wrote 5
that " 6
I 1
am 2
forced 6
to listen 9
to the barbarous German language 32
and to applaud, 15
despite myself 14
when 4
a drunken Burgundian 20
sings 5
his head perfumed 17
with rancid butter . " 22
But even though the Romans 26
mocked their Northern neighbors 31
liberal use of butter they 26
did use it on occasion as well, 31
not for pomade 14
or really for eating 20
but for ointments, 18
for burns, 10
or " 4
In cases 8
where 5
a leech has been swallowed, 27
butter is the usual remedy, 27
with vinegar 12
heated with a red - hot iron. 29
Indeed, 7
butter employed by itself 25
is a good remedy for poisons, 29
for where 9
oil is not to be procured, 26
it 2
is 2
an excellent substitute for it. 31
Used with honey, 16
butter heals injuries 21
and inflicted by millipedes ... 31
" 1
And this honey 14
and butter combination 22
was 3
very popular with the Franks 28
though not as a solve 21
for millipedes. 15
In the 6th Century Anthimus, 28
a Byzantine physician 21
who 3
spent time 10
at the Court of the Franks 26
wrote 5
that the men 12
there drank milk and ate butter 31
and should that butter 22
be unsalted 11
and " Pure and fresh 20
with a little honey mixed in, 29
lick it at intervals 20
while laying down . " 21
Yet today 9
if I 4
lie on the couch 16
while licking 13
a stick of honey covered butter 31
I would be judged harshly, 26
but we 6
have 4
reached that point in history 29
where 5
butter 6
is now for the most part 24
just for eating. 16
It 2
became 6
this staple of many cuisines 28
especially in Northern Europe. 30
In Ireland butter 17
was 3
often preserved 15
by storing it in peat bogs 26
where it would slowly ferment, 30
and could stay good for years. 30
Even now 3,000 year old 23
containers of bog butter 24
have 4
been 4
Unearthed 9
and judged edible by scientists. 32
Though I don't think 20
they've actually tried it. 26
Now whether or not it's 23
bog butter 10
or just just regular butter 27
the butter of Ireland 21
has been famous for centuries 29
and they 8
have 4
been proud of it 16
even when 9
mocked 6
by their English neighbors. 27
In the 1590s 12
the English traveler 20
Fynes Morrison 14
said of the Irish 17
that they 9
would " 7
swallow 7
whole lumps of filthy butter . " 32
But historically most 21
of anything 11
that the English 16
ever said about the Irish 25
is a little suspect, 20
and even Fynes Morrison's own 29
biographer 10
who was rather charitable to him 32
admitted 8
that " 6
he 2
had a sane charity for all men, 31
except Turks and Irish priests. 31
" 1
But it 6
wasn't just in Ireland 22
because butter 14
was 3
a staple 8
of the average diet 19
all over Medieval Europe. 25
Sometimes it 12
was 3
the super salted butter 23
that had 8
to be washed a few times 24
just to make it edible 22
but sometimes it 16
was 3
the rather costly May butter 28
which was made in May. 22
And this butter 15
was 3
so prized 9
that it 7
was often used as medicine. 27
It 2
was 3
also typically the yellowest 28
butter 6
of the year 11
due to the beta - carotene rich 31
fresh grass 11
that the cows 13
had 3
been 4
feeding 7
on over the previous month. 27
But it 6
was 3
so common 9
in an ingredient 16
during the Middle Ages 22
that it wasn't just for people. 31
" 1
If a sparrow hawk 17
is so ill that it rejects food, 31
open its beak with two hands 28
and push down its throat 24
some fresh butter 17
the size of a fava bean. 24
One or two hours later feed it 30
some fresh meat still warm . " 30
Though I 8
wonder 6
if sparrow hawks 16
were 4
allowed 7
to eat butter during Lent 25
because people were not. 24
The Catholic Church 19
forbade the eating of butter 28
during that 40 - day period 27
of Lent leading up to Easter, 29
which was really bad 20
when 4
the majority of your fat 24
came from butter. 17
Of course in Rome 17
where 5
the church 10
was 3
based 5
they had olive oil so giving up 31
butter 6
wasn't that big of a deal, 26
but most of Europe 18
didn't manufacture olive oil 28
so they 7
had 3
to import it 12
from places like Rome. 22
How convenient. 15
Now if you 10
did 3
need 4
to eat 6
butter instead of olive oil you 31
could ... 9
but you still had to pay. 25
Records 7
show 4
that in the 13th century 24
if you 6
were to eat butter during Lent 30
you 3
had 3
to pay 6
six denier 10
which was 9
about the price 15
of a nice capon 15
which could 11
be 2
an entire week's wages 22
for many workers. 17
So much money 13
was 3
brought in 10
by these dispensations 22
that they 9
are 3
said 4
to have 7
paid 4
for the 260 foot tower 22
built at the Cathedral in Rouen 31
in the 15th century 19
giving it 9
the name The Butter Tower. 26
[Tour de Beurre] 16
Now it's unlikely 17
that the tower 14
was 3
actually built 14
just using money 16
from butter dispensations 25
but it 6
doesn't mean 12
that they weren't a big deal, 29
and that the Church 19
was 3
bringing in a lot of money 26
from them. 10
In fact in 1520 15
Martin Luther 13
who headed up the Reformation 29
wrote 5
that " 6
In Rome they 12
make a mockery of fasting, 26
while forcing us 16
to eat an oil 13
that they themselves 20
would 5
not use to grease their shoes. 30
Then they 9
sell us 7
the right 9
to eat 6
the foods 9
forbidden on fast days ... 26
they 4
think the eating of butter 26
to be a worse sin than to lie, 30
blaspheme, or to be unchaste . " 32
Soon after this by popular 26
demand the Catholic Church 26
relented 8
and allowed the eating of butter 32
during Lent. 12
And forever after that butter 29
was a staple of French cuisine, 31
and indeed most 15
of the cuisines 15
of Northern Europe. 19
And by the 18th century 23
both in Europe and in America 29
butter 6
had 3
become more than just a regular 31
ingredient. 11
Writers talk of it 18
as the way that they would talk 31
of wine, 8
talking 7
about terroir 13
and the the food 16
that the cows were eating, 26
and what type of cow 20
was 3
giving 6
the best butter 15
in any given year. 18
Jersey cows 11
were 4
said 4
to give 7
wonderfully creamy butter 25
due to the high fat content 27
in their milk something 23
that actually still holds 25
true to this day. 17
And Guernsey cows 17
tend 4
to give 7
a higher carotene content 25
to their milk 13
which leads 11
to a deep yellow butter. 24
" 1
The Epping butter 17
is 2
most highly esteemed 20
in London and its neighborhood, 31
great part of it 16
is 2
made 4
from cows 9
which feed 10
during the summer months 24
in Epping Forest, 17
where 5
the leaves and shrubby plants 29
are 3
understood 10
greatly to contribute tribute 29
to its superior flavor. 23
Hmmm, yes, yes. 15
I'm 3
getting 7
hints 5
of shrubby plants on the palate. 32
Very, very nice. 16
Now this was 12
also a time 11
for innovation in butter. 25
No longer did you 17
have 4
to spend hours plunge 21
churning butter every few days 30
when 4
you 3
could 5
crank 5
churn it with a tool 20
like I used today. 18
Or better yet let 17
the dog do it for you. 22
A number 8
of dog - powered butter churns 30
came 4
on the market 13
in the 19th century, 20
but whether you 15
hand 4
churned 7
or dog churned your butter, 27
the problem of spoilage 23
was still a main concern 24
especially because butter 25
had become so common in food. 29
It's 4
why 3
it 2
was such a big deal 19
when 4
Betty Botter bought some butter 31
but she 7
said this butter is bitter. 27
If I put it in my batter it 27
will make the batter bitter, 28
and it 6
would make the batter bitter 28
and that's the problem. 23
Butter was in everything! 25
" A matter for despair 22
is regards bad butter is, 25
that at the tables 18
where it has used it 20
stands sentinel 15
at the door 11
to bar your way 15
to every other kind of food. 28
You 3
turn 4
from your dreadful half - slice 31
of bread 8
which fills your mouth 22
with bitterness, 16
to your beef - steak, 21
which proves 12
virulent with the same poison; 30
you 3
think 5
to take refuge 14
in vegetable diet, 18
and find the butter 19
in the string - beans, 22
and polluting 13
the innocence of early peas ... 31
Hungry and miserable, 21
you 3
think to solace yourself 24
at the dessert; 15
but the pastry is cursed, 25
the cake 8
is acrid with the same plague. 30
You 3
are ready to howl with despair 30
and your misery 15
is great upon you..." Indeed. 29
Now there 9
were 4
ways 4
to battle this rancid butter 28
like adding " 13
Darby's prophylactic fluid ... 30
cream it thoroughly, 20
then put the butter 19
in a clean vessel . " 21
But more 8
than anything 13
that just masked 16
the odor of the rancid butter, 30
didn't actually make 20
it not rancid. 14
It 2
really wasn't until the advent 30
of refrigeration 16
that bad butter 15
became 6
an occasional occurrence 24
rather than an ongoing scourge 30
at the dinner table. 20
And it's thanks to refrigeration 32
that I 6
can 3
count 5
on my unpasteurized butter 26
to last at least a few days 27
if I 4
don't eat it all before then. 29
And here we 11
are freshly churned butter. 27
Let me just slather it on there. 32
I'm 3
sure it was a little bit softer, 32
I 1
had 3
to put it into the refrigerator 31
so it didn't uh didn't go bad. 30
But should still taste good. 28
Here we go. 11
Hm. 3
Is 2
there anything better 21
than butter and bread? 22
Just butter maybe. 18
It is sweeter. 14
There is a sweetness to it, 27
they call it sweet butter. 26
There is a sweetness to it. 27
That- it's not like sugar sweet. 32
It's just like - 16
I 1
don't know 10
it's more fresh than butter 27
that you buy at the store. 26
It's 4
closer 6
to European style butter 24
which is 8
cultured butter so it has - 27
it has more bacteria. 21
It 2
has 3
just this more interesting 26
flavor 6
and it's absolutely delicious, 30
rather than American butter 27
which sometimes can 19
be a little on the bland side. 30
This is good. 13
This would 10
be 2
really great 12
to make 7
into like an herb butter 24
or something 12
like that so when 17
you 3
are 3
mixing it 9
with the paddles 16
that's 6
the time 8
to add in either some salt, 27
or some herbs - chop 20
up some thyme or parsley 24
or rosemary or something - add 30
it all in, 10
not too much 12
but add it all in and you'll 28
just have 9
a wonderful herb butter. 24
So when 7
I 1
say 3
make 4
some butter 11
you 3
can either use a stand mixer, 29
it'll take you no time. 23
There's 7
no reason to go churning it - 29
the plunge churner. 19
You don't have to do that. 26
You 3
can 3
also use 8
one 3
of these Really cool crank 26
churns, 7
makes you 9
feel 4
like you're 11
doing more work because you are. 32
It's a little tiring, 21
but it 6
only takes 10 or 15 minutes 27
and it's really easy. 21
Almost as easy 14
as putting together a website 29
with help 9
