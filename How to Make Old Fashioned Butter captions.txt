As Julia Child once said 24
with enough butter anything 27

is good, and that is 20
especially true 15

with fresh butter, 18
and so today I am going to hand 31

churn some fresh butter. 24

So thank you to Squarespace for 31
sponsoring this video 21

as I dive in to butter this time 32
on Tasting History. 19

So I've been searching for 26
an actual historic recipe 25

for making butter but they're 29
really hard to find because it 30

seems like throughout 21
most of history people just 27

knew how to make butter so 26
nobody really wrote it down. 28

It would just say make butter, 30
but I found 11

some partial instructions in 28
my favorite 17th century 24

cookbook' The Closet of 23
the Eminently Learned Sir 25

Kenelme Digbie Opened' and as if 32
the name of the cookbook 24

isn't fancy enough 18
the name of the recipe sure is. 31

" My lord of Saint Alban's Creme 32
Fouette. 8

Put as much 11
as you please to make, of 25

thick cream into a dish, 24
and whip it with 16

a bundle of white hard rushes, 30
-LRB-of such as they make whisks 32

to brush cloaks -RRB- 21
tied together, till 19

it come to be very thick, 25
and near a buttery substance. 29

If you whip it too long, it 27
will become butter..." So in his 32

trying 6
to tell you how not to make 27

butter he inadvertently 23
tells you how to make butter, 29

and that's really 17
all that butter is, it's 24

whipped cream that got 22
whipped too much until 22

all the buttermilk fell out. 28

But there are a few more steps 30
in making a proper butter. 26

Now there are 13
many, many types of butter 26

and one of the big delineators 30
is the fat content. 19

You really need at least 36% fat 32
but if you can find one with 28

40% fat 7
or even more all the better. 28

Also here in America 20
most of our milk and cream is 29

pasteurized which makes it so 29
the flavor is just 18

a little bit more bland, so if 30
you can find raw cream that is 30

going to make the best butter. 30

Also try to find cream that has 31
come from grass-fed cows because 32

it is going to have 19
more beta-carotene in it 24

which is going to lead 22
to a more yellow butter 23

rather than 11
the pale white butter 21

that you'll often 17
find at stores. 15

Then the only other thing 25
that you'll need 16

is some way to churn it. 24

Now you can go 14
the really old-fashioned way 28

and use 7
a plunger style butter churn, 29

and it will 11
take you all afternoon, or you 30

could also use a stand mixer 28
which will take you all of 26

five minutes very modern 24
but kind of achieves 20

the same thing, but I am going 30
to split the difference and use 31

use one of these hand cranked 29
jars, butter churns. 20

These were very popular 23
in the 19th century, it was 27

a way 5
to make less amount of butter so 32

you're not making a huge 24
churn of butter, and it 23

takes all of 15 minutes. 24

And I'll put 12
a link in the description to 28

where you can get one of these. 31

So first let your cream 23
come to room temperature 24

and then pour it into the jar 29
and screw the lid on, 21

and get to churning. 20

And it really helps 19
to pass the time if you 23

have a good churning song like 30
The Byrds � � � 15

this is my butter churn, 24
churn, churn. 13

� � � But regardless of 23
your chosen soundtrack after 28

seven or eight minutes you 26
should have something similar 29

to whipped cream, and that means 32
that 4

you are about halfway there, so 31
continue to churn 17

the whipped cream 17
for about one more song. 24

� � � Churn the cream around, 29
love to make that butter. 25

� � � And then almost in 24
an instant it will become 25

very difficult to churn anymore, 32
and that is when the buttermilk 31

separates from the fat, the fat 31
being the butter. 17

Pour out as much buttermilk as 30
you possibly can and then 25

put the butter into a bowl. 27

Now the goal here is 20
to remove as much buttermilk 28

from the butter as possible, 28
and it will make it last longer. 32

So the first way to do that is 30
to wash the butter. 19

So pour very cold water over 28
the butter and knead the butter 31

while the water gets all murky. 31

And it is really important that 31
it is ice cold water 20

or else the butter 18
will just melt. 15

Then remove that water 22
and repeat 10

the process with clean water 28
for three or four times, 24

or until the water 18
remains fairly clear 20

even as you rinse it. 21

Then dry the butter in 22
some tightly woven cheesecloth, 31

wringing out as much liquid 27
as possible. 12

And again it's really important 31
that it's very 14

cold butter or else it just 27
melts and goes 14

through the cheesecloth, and it 31
turns out August in 19

my house not the best weather 29
for making butter, so I ended up 32

having to put it 16
into the refrigerator 21

several times 13
just to make it manageable, 27

and even then after like 24
10 seconds of working with it 29

it would start to melt. 23

Yeah, make 10
this during the winter. 23

The next step in 16
getting even more buttermilk out 32

is with paddles. 16

Basically you're going 22
to squeeze the butter together 30

as more liquid comes out and you 32
can use your hands for this, 28

but again your hands 20
will make it melt. 18

Even with the paddles mine 26
was melted, 11

made an absolute mess. 22

If it's cold it 15
doesn't make that mess. 23

Either way push it into 23
any shape that you like 23

and it's ready to eat. 22

Now this is historically what is 32
called sweet butter 19

or fresh butter 15
and it's ready to eat. 22

The problem is it really doesn't 32
last very long, four or five 28

days tops before 16
it starts to go rancid. 23

That's why throughout 21
most of history salt 20

was added to the butter and it 30
was added at this stage, 24

but for most of history it's not 32
like salted butter today where 30

they add you 12
know a little bit, just 23

give it some flavor. 20

They would add a ton of salt, 29
about 10 times the salt that is 31

added today 11
to be used as a preservative, 29

thereby making 14
it rather unpalatable. 22

So when you did want to eat 27
that super salted butter you 28

would have to follow in 23
instructions like these from 28

the 14th century' 17
Le M� � nagier de 17

Paris' " To desalt butter, 26
put it in a bowl on the fire 28

to melt, and the salt will fall 31
to the bottom of the bowl, 26

This salt is good in potage. 28

The remainder of the butter 27
stays sweet. 12

Otherwise, 10
put your salted butter 22

into fresh water, knead it 26
and pound it, and the salt 26

will stay in the water. " 25

I'm not adding enough salt 26
to my butter to preserve it 27

but I might add 15
just a little bit for flavoring 31

but before I do that let's talk 31
about the history of this most 30

important ingredient. 21

Butter has 10
been around for a long time 27

and while we don't know 23
exactly how 11

it was invented there 21
are some theories. 18

One is that somewhere 21
in Central Asia some cream was 30

put into 8
a container of some sort 24

and kept on the saddle and while 32
galloping along it 18

churned the cream into butter. 30

But instead 11
of butter from a cow it was 27

more likely that it was butter 30
from a yak or a camel, 22

both of which are still 23
made today. 11

Further north reindeer milk 27
was also common 15

and supposedly great 20
for making butter, for while 28

reindeer don't give much milk 29
it's incredibly high in 23

fat making for the best butter. 31

Now the earliest images we have 31
of people churning butter comes 31

from the Sumerian city of Ur. 29

It shows two men 16
rocking a clay urn 18

back and forth to 17
churn the butter, a process 27

still used in some parts 24
of the world today. 19

From there butter 17
diverged mostly 15

in how it was preserved. 24

The first and frankly more 26
delicious way was 17

to melt the butter, and let 27
the liquid separate rate 24

from the milk solids. 21

Those milk solids then would 28
go rancid less quickly, 23

and that is called ghee. 24

This method was and is 22
used today in India as well as 30

much of 7
the Middle East and Africa, 27

and not only 12
is it great for cooking 23

but in its purest form it is 28
used in oil lamps 17

or offered to Lord Krishna. 27

Now the other way 17
to preserve butter was as I 27

mentioned adding a lot of salt 30
and that's the way 18

that most people in 19
the northern climates 21

of Asia and Europe did it, 26
and the Greeks and Romans 25

talked about people from 24
those areas 11

eating a lot of butter. 23

The Greek poet Anaxandrides 27
going so far as to dub 22

the population of 17
Thrace baoutyrophagoi, 22

or butter eaters. 17

And Pliny the Elder say that 28
butter is " Held as 19

the choicest food 17
among barbarian tribes, and one 31

which distinguishes the wealthy 31
from the multitude at large ... 31

the more rank 13
it is in smell, the more 24

highly it is esteemed. " 24

Now this rank or rancid butter 30
wasn't really for eating 24

but rather for for washing. 27

The physician Galen said that " 31
People in many cold regions 27

where they lack olive oil 25
use butter 10

for washing themselves. " 25

And those living north 22
of the Roman Empire were 24

known to slick back their hair 30
with this rancid butter 23

similar to pomade. 18

When visiting 13
the Burgundian Court 20

in the 4th Century Bishop 25
Sidonis Apollinaris wrote that " 32

I am forced to listen to the 28
barbarous German language 25

and to applaud, despite myself 30
when a drunken Burgundian sings 31

his head perfumed 17
with rancid butter. " 21

But even though the Romans 26
mocked their Northern neighbors 31

liberal use of butter they did 30
use it on occasion as well, not 31

for pomade or really for eating 31
but for ointments, for 22

burns, or " In cases where 26
a leech has been swallowed, 27

butter is the usual remedy, with 32
vinegar heated 14

with a red-hot iron. 20

Indeed, 7
butter employed by itself 25

is a good remedy for poisons, 29
for where 9

oil is not to be procured, it is 32
an excellent substitute for it. 31

Used with honey, butter heals 29
injuries 8

and inflicted by millipedes..." 31
And this honey 14

and butter combination was 26
very popular 12

with the Franks though not 26
as a solve for millipedes. 26

In the 6th Century Anthimus, 28
a Byzantine physician who 25

spent time 10
at the Court of the Franks wrote 32

that the men there 18
drank milk and ate butter 25

and should that butter 22
be unsalted and " Pure and fresh 32

with a little honey mixed in, 29
lick it at intervals 20

while laying down. " 20

Yet today if I lie on the couch 31
while licking a stick 21

of honey covered butter I 25
would be judged harshly, but we 31

have reached 12
that point in history where 27

butter 6
is now for the most part just 29

for eating. 11

It became this staple 21
of many cuisines especially in 30

Northern Europe. 16

In Ireland butter was often 27
preserved by 12

storing it in peat bogs where 29
it would slowly ferment, 24

and could stay good for years. 30

Even now 8
3,000 year old containers 25

of bog butter have been 23
Unearthed and judged edible 27

by scientists. 14

Though I don't think 20
they've actually tried it. 26

Now whether or not it's 23
bog butter or just 18

just regular butter 19
the butter of Ireland has 25

been famous for centuries 25
and they have been proud of it 30

even when mocked 16
by their English neighbors. 27

In the 1590s 12
the English traveler 20

Fynes Morrison said of the Irish 32
that they would " swallow 25

whole lumps of filthy butter. " 31

But historically most of 24
anything that the English ever 30

said about the Irish 20
is a little suspect, and even 29

Fynes Morrison's own biographer 31
who was rather charitable to him 32

admitted that " he had 22
a sane charity for all men, 27

except 6
Turks and Irish priests. " 26

But it wasn't just in Ireland 29
because butter was a staple of 30

the average diet 16
all over Medieval Europe. 25

Sometimes it was 16
the super salted butter that had 32

to be washed a few times 24
just to make it edible 22

but sometimes it was 20
the rather costly May butter 28

which was made in May. 22

And this butter was so prized 29
that it 7

was often used as medicine. 27

It was also typically 21
the yellowest butter of the year 32

due to the beta-carotene 24
rich fresh grass that the cows 30

had been feeding 16
on over the previous month. 27

But it was so common in 23
an ingredient 13

during the Middle Ages that 27
it wasn't just for people. 26

" If a sparrow hawk is so ill 29
that it rejects food, 21

open its beak with two hands 28
and push down its throat 24

some fresh butter 17
the size of a fava bean. 24

One or two hours later feed it 30
some fresh meat still warm. " 29

Though I wonder if sparrow hawks 32
were allowed 12

to eat butter during Lent 25
because people were not. 24

The Catholic Church forbade 27
the eating of butter during that 32

40-day period of Lent 21
leading up to Easter, 21

which was really bad when 25
the majority of your fat 24

came from butter. 17

Of course in Rome where 23
the church was based they 25

had olive oil so giving up 26
butter 6

wasn't that big of a deal, 26
but most of Europe didn't 25

manufacture olive oil so they 29
had to import it 16

from places like Rome. 22

How convenient. 15

Now if you did need to eat 26
butter instead of olive oil you 31

could ... 9
but you still had to pay. 25

Records show that 17
in the 13th century if you were 31

to eat butter during Lent you 29
had to pay six denier which was 31

about the price of a nice capon 31
which could be 14

an entire week's wages 22
for many workers. 17

So much money was brought in by 31
these dispensations that they 29

are said to have paid for 25
the 260 foot tower built 24

at the Cathedral in Rouen in 28
the 15th century giving it 26

the name The Butter Tower. 26

[Tour de Beurre] Now 20
it's unlikely that the tower 28

was actually built just 23
using money 11

from butter dispensations but it 32
doesn't mean that 17

they weren't a big deal, 24
and that the Church was 23

bringing in 11
a lot of money from them. 25

In fact in 1520 Martin Luther 29
who headed up the Reformation 29

wrote that " In Rome they 25
make a mockery of fasting, while 32

forcing us to eat an oil that 29
they themselves would not 25

use to grease their shoes. 26

Then they sell us the right 27
to eat the foods forbidden 26

on fast days...they 19
think the eating of butter 26

to be a worse sin than 22
to lie, blaspheme, 18

or to be unchaste. " 20

Soon after 10
this by popular demand 22

the Catholic Church relented 28
and allowed the eating of butter 32

during Lent. 12

And forever after that butter 29
was a staple of French cuisine, 31

and indeed most of the cuisines 31
of Northern Europe. 19

And by the 18th century 23
both in Europe 14

and in America butter 21
had become more than just 25

a regular ingredient. 21

Writers talk of it as 21
the way that they would talk 28

of wine, talking about terroir 30
and the the food 16

that the cows were eating, 26
and what type of cow was giving 31

the best butter 15
in any given year. 18

Jersey cows were said to give 29
wonderfully creamy butter due to 32

the high fat content 20
in their milk something 23

that actually still 19
holds true to this day. 23

And Guernsey cows tend to give 30
a higher carotene content to 28

their milk which leads 22
to a deep yellow butter. 24

" The Epping butter is 22
most highly esteemed in London 30

and its neighborhood, 21
great part of it is made from 29

cows which feed during 22
the summer months 17

in Epping Forest, where 23
the leaves and shrubby plants 29

are understood greatly 22
to contribute tribute 21

to its superior flavor. 23

Hmmm, yes, yes. 15

I'm getting hints of 20
shrubby plants on the palate. 29

Very, very nice. 16

Now this was also a time 24
for innovation in butter. 25

No longer did you have 22
to spend hours plunge 21

churning butter every few days 30
when you could crank 20

churn it with a tool 20
like I used today. 18

Or better yet let 17
the dog do it for you. 22

A number 8
of dog-powered butter churns 28

came on the market 18
in the 19th century, but whether 32

you hand churned 16
or dog churned your butter, 27

the problem of spoilage 23
was still a main concern 24

especially because butter had 29
become so common in food. 25

It's why it was such a big deal 31
when Betty Botter 17

bought some butter but she 26
said this butter is bitter. 27

If I put it in my batter it will 32
make the batter bitter, and it 30

would make the batter bitter 28
and that's the problem. 23

Butter was in everything! 25

" A matter for despair is 25
regards bad butter is, that at 30

the tables where it has used it 31
stands sentinel at the door 27

to bar your way 15
to every other kind of food. 28

You turn from 13
your dreadful half-slice of 27

bread which fills your mouth 28
with bitterness, to 19

your beef-steak, which proves 29
virulent with the same poison; 30

you think to take refuge 24
in vegetable diet, 18

and find the butter 19
in the string-beans, 20

and polluting the innocence 27
of early peas ... 17

Hungry and miserable, you 25
think to solace yourself 24

at the dessert; 15
but the pastry is cursed, 25

the cake is acrid 17
with the same plague. 21

You are ready to howl 21
with despair and your misery 28

is great upon you..." Indeed. 29

Now there were ways 19
to battle this rancid butter 28

like adding " Darby's 21
prophylactic fluid...cream 26

it thoroughly, then 19
put the butter 14

in a clean vessel. " 20

But more than anything that just 32
masked the odor 15

of the rancid butter, 21
didn't actually 15

make it not rancid. 19

It really wasn't until 22
the advent of refrigeration 27

that bad butter became 22
an occasional occurrence 24

rather than an ongoing scourge 30
at the dinner table. 20

And it's thanks to refrigeration 32
that I can count on 19

my unpasteurized butter 23
to last at least a few days if I 32

don't eat it all before then. 29

And here we 11
are freshly churned butter. 27

Let me just slather it on there. 32

I'm sure 8
it was a little bit softer, I 29

had to put it 13
into the refrigerator so 24

it didn't uh didn't go bad. 27

But should still taste good. 28

Here we go. 11

Hm. 3

Is there anything better 24
than butter and bread? 22

Just butter maybe. 18

It is sweeter. 14

There is a sweetness to it, they 32
call it sweet butter. 21

There is a sweetness to it. 27

That- it's not like sugar sweet. 32

It's just like-I don't know 27
it's more fresh than butter 27

that you buy at the store. 26

It's closer to 14
European style butter which is 30

cultured butter so it has-it 28
has more bacteria. 18

It has just this more 21
interesting flavor and it's 27

absolutely delicious, 21
rather than American butter 27

which sometimes can be 22
a little on the bland side. 27

This is good. 13

This would be really great 26
to make into like 17

an herb butter or something like 32
that so when you are mixing it 30

with the paddles that's the time 32
to add in either some salt, 27

or some herbs-chop up 21
some thyme or parsley 21

or rosemary or something-add 28
it all in, not too much 23

but add it all in 17
and you'll just have 20

a wonderful herb butter. 24

So when I say make some butter 30
you can either 14

use a stand mixer, 18
it'll take you no time. 23

There's 7
no reason to go churning it- 28

the plunge churner. 19

You don't have to do that. 26

You can also use one of 23
these Really cool crank churns, 31

makes you feel like you're 26
doing more work because you are. 32

It's a little tiring, 21
but it only 11

takes 10 or 15 minutes 22
and it's really easy. 21
