Forget looking to the stars in search
of strange alien lifeforms,

2
it's our own planet's deep ocean
that's offering up the chance

3
to find new life,
but not as we know it.

4
Now,
when we talk about the deep ocean,

5
we generally mean the point
at which light

6
starts to decrease rapidly,
which is typically

7
about 200 metres and below.

8
At depths of over 1000 metres,
the ocean becomes completely dark.

9
Combine this with near freezing
temperatures and extreme pressure,

10
it's no wonder that for a long time,
scientists believed

11
that life in the ocean's depths was
impossible.

12
However,
we now understand that the deep ocean

13
is a rich ecosystem of marine life.

14
In a recent study,
scientists discovered more than 5,000

15
new species living on the seabed
in the Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ)

16
a large stretch of seafloor
between Hawaii and Mexico.

17
What surprised me most about our
study is the level

18
of undescribed biodeversity
in the area.

19
We found 90% of the species
from the region are new to science.

20
A particular favourite animals
of mine from the CCZ are the Glass

21
Sponges.

22
They have stalks
which are literally made of glass

23
and that they form on the sea floor
in these very low temperatures,

24
which is really an incredile feat
of physics.

25
This work is so pressing
because the CCZ is an area

26
that has been earmarked for deep sea
mining,

27
and the current deadline to the pause
on deep sea mining is due

28
to come to an end in July.

29
This makes it particularly important
for us to try and characterise

30
and understand the biodiversity
of the region

31
because we don't understand what
the impacts may be,

32
if we don't know what biodiversity is
there in the first place.

33
There
are thought to be up to two million

34
species living in the oceans,
with some estimates putting

35
the figure higher.

36
So far we know
about fewer than 250,000,

37
according to the World Register
of Marine Species.

38
It's a very exciting time
to be starting to build up a picture

39
of the biodiversity and ecology
of the deep ocean,

40
as well as understanding what
that can tell us about evolution

41
of life on this planet.
