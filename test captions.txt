Now you can go 14
the really old - fashioned way 30

and use 7
a plunger style butter churn, 29

and it 6
will take you all afternoon, 28

or you could also use 21
a stand mixer which will 24

take you all of five minutes. 29

Very modern but kind of achieves 32
the same thing. 15

But I 5
am going to split the difference 32

and use use 11
one of these hand cranked jars, 31

butter churns. 14
