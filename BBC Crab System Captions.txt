Plastic.

2
12 million tons of it
end up in the ocean every year.

3
Each year,
it's likely

4
over half a million animals
are ensnared and killed

5
by these ghost nets.

6
But some animals are learning
how to take advantage

7
of the plastic rafts ...
and use them

8
for shelter or even as a home.

9
This male Columbus crab,
barely bigger

10
than your thumbnail,
is a castaway.

11
Clinging to his net,
he may have been drifting

12
on ocean currents for months.

13
Now fully grown,
he needs to find a partner.

14
Columbus crabs
are not good swimmers.

15
So this male is marooned.

16
Perhaps
a passing loggerhead turtle

17
could be
the chance to hitch a lift.

18
Made it.

19
But there is
more than one passenger here --

20
a female Columbus Crab.

21
They waste no time
in getting acquainted.

22
And start to mate.

23
This pair may well stay together
for the rest of their lives.

24
The turtle, after all,
makes an excellent home.

25
In return,
the crabs provide

26
an onboard grooming service.
