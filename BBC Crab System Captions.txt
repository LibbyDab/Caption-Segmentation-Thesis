Plastic.

2
12 million tons of it end up
in the ocean every year.

3
Each year,
it's likely over half a million

4
animals are ensnared and killed
by these ghost nets.

5
But some animals are learning
how

6
to take advantage of the plastic
rafts ...

7
and use them for shelter or even
as a home.

8
This male Columbus crab,
barely bigger than your

9
thumbnail, is a castaway.

10
Clinging to his net,
he may have been drifting

11
on ocean currents for months.

12
Now fully grown,
he needs to find a partner.

13
Columbus crabs are
not good swimmers.

14
So this male is marooned.

15
Perhaps a passing loggerhead
turtle could be the chance

16
to hitch a lift.

17
Made it.

18
But there is more than one
passenger here --

19
a female Columbus Crab.

20
They waste no time
in getting acquainted.

21
And start to mate.

22
This pair may well stay together
for the rest of their lives.

23
The turtle, after all,
makes an excellent home.

24
In return,
the crabs provide

25
an onboard grooming service.
