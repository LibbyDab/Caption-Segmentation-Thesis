Now you can go the really old-fashioned way and use a plunger style butter churn, and it will take you all afternoon, or you could also use a stand mixer which will take you all of five minutes. Very modern but kind of achieves the same thing. But I am going to split the difference and use use one of these hand cranked jars, butter churns.
