00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:19,159
The barn owl is unquestionably a
beautiful bird. It has a

2
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,624
distinctive heart-shaped face,
mottled brown and grey wings

3
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:26,900
with pure white underparts. They
have a wingspan of around 80-95

4
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:33,356
cm and weigh in at 250-350g. It
is considered to be one of

5
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:36,656
Britain's most popular birds and
one of the more commonly seen

6
00:00:36,657 --> 00:00:40,178
owls due to its readiness to
hunt during the day, although

7
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:44,085
dusk is probably the best time
to see one. They are silent

8
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:47,857
hunters, tiny serrations on the
leading edges of their flight

9
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:51,253
feathers and a hairlike fringe
on the trailing edges help to

10
00:00:51,254 --> 00:00:54,514
break up the flow of air over
the wings and this reduces

11
00:00:54,515 --> 00:00:59,528
turbulence and the noise it
would cause. The barn owl flies

12
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:02,628
slowly while hunting and will
hover over spots where prey

13
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:06,486
might be hiding. The barn owl
has fantastic hearing with

14
00:01:06,487 --> 00:01:09,900
asymmetrical ears which improves
the owl's ability to pinpoint

15
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:13,714
the position and distance of
sounds. Their heart-shaped face

16
00:01:13,715 --> 00:01:17,413
also aids the owl's ability to
hear. It's been shown that if

17
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:20,250
the ruff feathers are removed,
the owl can still determine the

18
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,613
sounds position, but not its
height. Barn owls' main source

19
00:01:26,614 --> 00:01:30,745
of prey are rodents and other
small mammals, in fact, over 90%

20
00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:34,243
of an owl's diet is made up of
such animals. But it will also

21
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:38,770
prey upon other birds, lizards,
amphibians, fish, spiders, and

22
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:43,913
insects. The barn owl has a high
metabolic rate, more so than

23
00:01:43,914 --> 00:01:47,600
most other owls of a similar
size. This means it requires

24
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:51,029
relatively more food.
Observations have shown that the

25
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,657
barn owl will eat around 14% of
its own body weight of rodents

26
00:01:54,658 --> 00:01:58,714
per night. It may also store
excess food at roosting sites

27
00:01:58,715 --> 00:02:02,572
which it will return to if food
is scarce. Their high rate of

28
00:02:02,573 --> 00:02:05,730
rodent kills makes them very
valuable to farmers who wish to

29
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:09,286
keep the rodent population down.
Barn owls are said to be more

30
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:14,071
effective than poison for rodent
control. As their name suggests,

31
00:02:14,072 --> 00:02:17,530
barn owls will nest in cavities
of barns and old buildings as

32
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,214
well as hollows of trees. Nests
are built on top of the previous

33
00:02:21,215 --> 00:02:25,274
year's nests. There is no set
breeding season for these owls,

34
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:29,686
and this largely depends on the
available food supply, but most

35
00:02:29,687 --> 00:02:33,829
commonly occurs between March
and August. Around 4-6 eggs will

36
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,414
be laid and up to 2 broods will
be raised in a year. Barn owls

37
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:42,142
are fairly common and be seen
all over Britain and Ireland,

38
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:45,870
although populations are under
threat in Northern Ireland. They

39
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:48,885
did go through a dramatic
population decline all over

40
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:52,957
Britain during the 1950s and
60s, dipping down to as low as

41
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:57,000
4000 breeding pairs. This was
most likely due to the use of

42
00:02:57,001 --> 00:03:01,013
toxic farm chemicals such as
DDT, but also loss of hunting

43
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:06,014
habitat, and two particularly
harsh winters of 1946/47 and

44
00:03:06,015 --> 00:03:11,514
1962/63. Barn owls can also be
susceptible to poisoning by

45
00:03:11,515 --> 00:03:16,100
ingesting rodents killed by
rodenticides. Nesting sites are

46
00:03:16,101 --> 00:03:19,686
also scarce due to many old
barns and buildings being

47
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:23,238
demolished or renovated.
Luckily, population numbers are

48
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:26,200
thought to be on the rise due to
improved conservation efforts

49
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:29,857
and many nest boxes being built.
These nest boxes have also

50
00:03:29,858 --> 00:03:32,642
allowed populations of owls to
inhabit areas that they

51
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:36,514
previously were absent from,
such as the fens. Although it

52
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:39,514
seems the population is fairly
healthy, having increased to

53
00:03:39,515 --> 00:03:43,580
around 14,000 breeding pairs, it
is acknowledged that monitoring

54
00:03:43,581 --> 00:03:46,900
of nocturnal birds is difficult
and population studies are

55
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:51,414
somewhat unreliable. Barn owls
have a typical lifespan of

56
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:55,229
around 4 years, typically
breeding at 1 year. However, the

57
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,600
oldest confirmed age by the
British Trust for Ornithology,

58
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:02,780
was 15 years, 3 months, and 21
days.
