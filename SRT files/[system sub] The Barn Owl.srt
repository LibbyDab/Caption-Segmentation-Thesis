1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,820
The barn owl is unquestionably
a beautiful bird.

2
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,220
It has
a distinctive heart-shaped face,

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,740
mottled brown and grey wings
with pure white underparts.

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,428
They have a wingspan
of around 80-95 cm and weigh in

5
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:31,600
at 250-350g.

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,157
It is considered to be one
of Britain's most popular birds

7
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:37,389
and one of the more
commonly seen owls

8
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,940
due to its readiness to hunt
during the day,

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,340
although dusk is probably
the best time to see one.

10
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,243
They are silent hunters,
tiny serrations

11
00:00:46,271 --> 00:00:48,300
on the leading edges of their
flight feathers

12
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,929
and a hairlike fringe
on the trailing edges

13
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:54,560
help to break up the flow of air
over the wings and this reduces

14
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,780
turbulence and the noise
it would cause.

15
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,668
The barn owl flies slowly
while hunting and will hover

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,290
over spots where prey
might be hiding.

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,343
The barn owl has
fantastic hearing

18
00:01:06,354 --> 00:01:09,120
with asymmetrical ears
which improves the owl's ability

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,660
to pinpoint the position
and distance of sounds.

20
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,400
Their heart-shaped face
also aids the owl's ability

21
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:16,460
to hear.

22
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,100
It's been shown
that if the ruff feathers

23
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:20,157
are removed,
the owl can still determine

24
00:01:20,186 --> 00:01:23,343
the sounds position,
but not its height.

25
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,943
Barn owls' main source of prey
are rodents

26
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,820
and other small mammals,
in fact,

27
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,620
over 90% of an owl's diet
is made up of such animals.

28
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,914
But it will also prey
upon other birds, lizards,

29
00:01:36,943 --> 00:01:40,490
amphibians, fish, spiders,
and insects.

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,180
The barn owl has
a high metabolic rate,

31
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,570
more so than most other owls
of a similar size.

32
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,780
This means it requires
relatively more food.

33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Observations have shown
that the barn owl will eat

34
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,780
around 14% of its own body
weight of rodents per night.

35
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,957
It may also store excess food
at roosting sites which it

36
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:01,850
will return to if food is
scarce.

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,440
Their high rate of rodent kills
makes them very valuable

38
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,329
to farmers who
wish to keep the rodent

39
00:02:06,357 --> 00:02:08,020
population down.

40
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,829
Barn owls
are said to be more effective

41
00:02:09,857 --> 00:02:12,580
than poison for rodent control.

42
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,959
As their name suggests,
barn owls will nest

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,657
in cavities of barns
and old buildings as well

44
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:19,780
as hollows of trees.

45
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,500
Nests are built on top
of the previous year's nests.

46
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,660
There is no set breeding season
for these owls,

47
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,170
and this largely depends
on the available food supply,

48
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,730
but most commonly occurs
between March and August.

49
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,357
Around 4-6 eggs will be laid
and up to 2 broods

50
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:37,871
will be raised in a year.

51
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,211
Barn owls are fairly common
and be seen all over Britain

52
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:43,414
and Ireland,
although populations are

53
00:02:43,443 --> 00:02:45,610
under threat in Northern
Ireland.

54
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,100
They did
go through a dramatic population

55
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:51,757
decline all over Britain
during the 1950s and 60s,

56
00:02:51,786 --> 00:02:55,260
dipping down to as low as 4000
breeding pairs.

57
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,829
This was most likely
due to the use of toxic farm

58
00:02:57,843 --> 00:03:00,386
chemicals such as DDT,
but also

59
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,300
loss of hunting habitat,
and two

60
00:03:02,301 --> 00:03:08,820
particularly harsh winters
of 1946/47 and 1962/63.

61
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,200
Barn owls can also be
susceptible to poisoning

62
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,100
by ingesting rodents killed
by rodenticides.

63
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,700
Nesting sites are also scarce
due to many old barns

64
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,900
and buildings being demolished
or renovated.

65
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,054
Luckily,
population numbers

66
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:25,357
are thought to be on the rise
due to improved conservation

67
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,700
efforts and many nest boxes
being built.

68
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,343
These nest boxes have
also allowed populations of owls

69
00:03:31,371 --> 00:03:34,071
to inhabit areas that they
previously were absent from,

70
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:36,100
such as the fens.

71
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,643
Although it seems the population
is fairly healthy,

72
00:03:38,671 --> 00:03:41,800
having increased
to around 14,000 breeding pairs,

73
00:03:41,814 --> 00:03:43,414
it is acknowledged
that monitoring

74
00:03:43,443 --> 00:03:46,743
of nocturnal birds is difficult
and population studies are

75
00:03:46,786 --> 00:03:49,740
somewhat unreliable.

76
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,257
Barn owls have
a typical lifespan of around 4

77
00:03:52,286 --> 00:03:54,820
years,
typically breeding at 1 year.

78
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,550
However,
the oldest confirmed age

79
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:59,757
by the British Trust
for Ornithology, was 15 years,

80
00:03:59,786 --> 00:04:02,660
3 months, and 21 days.

81
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,420
The barn owl is clearly
a beautiful bird,

82
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,420
easy on the eyes you might say,
but not so easy on the ears.

83
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,957
Other names for this bird
include 'screech owl,

84
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:14,429
and 'demon owl'
which might give you some idea

85
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:16,300
as to what they sound like!

86
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,600
But this is the'
beautiful birds' series,

87
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:28,986
not' beautiful sounding birds'
series,

88
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:30,820
so its place is well deserved.

89
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:33,259
Thank you

90
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:34,557
