1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,860
Can you move out
of the way, though?

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,140
You gotta move over here, sir.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,243
OK, thank you.

4
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:14,759
Hey.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,100
How you guys doing, huh?

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,280
Today we're going to be

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,420
introducing our two new muntjac,
Tyler and Peanut, to Chowlie.

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,420
Muntjac are a small
Asian species.

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,660
What I like about them is,

10
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,340
they like to hide,
and they're very, very sneaky.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,640
They actually were introduced

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,780
also, in England, and they're
kind of a nuisance in England.

13
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,240
I just find it very interesting
that an animal from Asia was

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,420
introduced into an area where
they're not supposed to be.

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,780
They're also called
barking deer.

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,800
That's how they communicate
with each other and warn each

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,420
other of any kind of danger,
which I think is kind of cool.

18
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,100
Here you go, Chowlie girl.

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,280
Chowlie, she's going to be kind

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,900
of like the grandma
of the bunch.

21
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,940
She's an older female, but she
's experienced out there.

22
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,220
So I see her really kind
of taking the leadership role.

23
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,580
There's such a cute animal.

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,580
Everybody thinks they're
babies, they are not.

25
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,180
Tyler and Peanut are still doing
a little bit of growing,

26
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,210
but for the most part, they
are a very small deer species.

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,180
They're a year
and two years old.

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,260
And they're just really fun.

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,360
Everyone loves Chowlie,
so these two are just going

30
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,280
to be a great
addition to our area.

31
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:23,880
This is our little makeshift
wall that we use a lot of times,

32
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,740
when we're doing introductions
with hoofstock.

33
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,100
And it's solid,
so the deer can see it.

34
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,260
The tough thing about muntjac,

35
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,260
is they get wound
up really easy.

36
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,540
I mean, they can
overheat really quickly.

37
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,400
It's actually pretty
frustrating, because sometimes

38
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,180
you're like, just calm down,
it's not that big a deal.

39
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,480
And it's really a small

40
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,420
hoofstock, a small
ungulate thing.

41
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,840
These guys are food,
so if there is aggression,

42
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,540
and we get some chasing
and stuff like that,

43
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,620
we can quickly try to time
that and separate them,

44
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,780
and stop that aggression
if that happens.

45
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,460
Let's get two more sheets.

46
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,780
Hi, cute deer.

47
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,780
So I've been at the zoo
about 24 years.

48
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,660
And one of the things I love is,

49
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,850
I really look at what
animals behaviors are.

50
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,420
Excuse me.

51
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,100
Can we talk some more?

52
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,800
I try very hard not to analyze
them and put my own impressions

53
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,610
on them, but it's
kind of hard not to.

54
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,540
Hey.

55
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,500
We've been talking
all night long.

56
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,170
This is my formal
greeting, I am Tyler.

57
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,450
It's just-- it geeks me out.
Easy.

58
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,680
I got it.
You're all right.

59
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
I think, yeah.

60
00:02:32,283 --> 00:02:35,114
I think they'll be
excited to be outside.

61
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,780
All right, good luck.

62
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,200
OK, ready?

63
00:02:46,314 --> 00:02:46,870
We

64
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:49,169
open the crates,
and as soon as we get them open,

65
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,860
they, of course, jump out
and go pretty quickly.

66
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,820
They think they kind of realize,
oh, we're outside, you know.

67
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,000
So then I think it kind of calms

68
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,900
down once they're
out of the crate.

69
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:00,986
I like this tree,
it's very delicious.

70
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,729
Quick, look at all these grass.

71
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,900
Where is Chowlie?

72
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,580
Hope she gets up investigates.

73
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,560
Oh, there she is, OK.

74
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,860
Chowlie's still laying down,
not caring about anything.

75
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,080
Chowlie is just laying down

76
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,020
right now, so she hasn
't really gotten up.

77
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,980
I'm sure she notices something's
going on, because obviously,

78
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,780
us coming in with crates
is not her norm.

79
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,700
But right now, she's calm,
she's laying down,

80
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,220
while they're kind
of investigating their area.

81
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,700
So you have some friends.

82
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,120
Yeah.

83
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,420
I think everything went well.

84
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,020
Hopefully those two will
interact through the lattice,

85
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,500
and we'll see what they do,

86
00:03:36,530 --> 00:04:05,920
and we'll continue tomorrow.
