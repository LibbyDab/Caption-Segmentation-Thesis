1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,560
Plastic.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:16,160
12 million tons of it end
up in the ocean every year.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,160
Each year,
it's likely over half a million

4
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:24,920
animals are ensnared and killed
by these ghost nets.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,760
But some animals are learning

6
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,960
how to take advantage
of the plastic rafts...

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,840
and use them for shelter
or even as a home.

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,100
This male Columbus crab,

9
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:47,000
barely bigger than your
thumbnail, is a castaway.

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,580
Clinging to his net,

11
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,880
he may have been drifting
on ocean currents for months.

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,240
Now fully grown,
he needs to find a partner.

13
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,540
Columbus crabs are
not good swimmers.

14
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:08,660
So this male is marooned.

15
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,560
Perhaps a passing loggerhead

16
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,080
turtle could be the chance
to hitch a lift.

17
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,040
Made it.

18
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,100
But there is more than one

19
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:57,640
passenger here --
a female Columbus Crab.

20
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,440
They waste no time
in getting aquainted.

21
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:17,800
And start to mate.

22
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,610
This pair may well stay together
for the rest of their lives.

23
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:33,680
The turtle, after all,
makes an excellent home.

24
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,880
In return, the crabs provide
an onboard grooming service.
