1
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:07,600
Can you move out of the way,
though? You gotta move over

2
00:00:07,601 --> 00:00:14,714
here, sir. OK, thank you. Hey.

3
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,517
How you guys doing, huh?

4
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,057
Today we're going to be
introducing our two new muntjac,

5
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:22,242
Tyler and Peanut, to Chowlie.

6
00:00:22,243 --> 00:00:25,186
Muntjac are a small Asian
species. What I like about them

7
00:00:25,187 --> 00:00:28,526
is, they like to hide, and
they're very, very sneaky. They

8
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:31,486
actually were introduced also,
in England, and they're kind of

9
00:00:31,487 --> 00:00:34,843
a nuisance in England. I just
find it very interesting that an

10
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:39,029
animal from Asia was introduced
into an area where they're not

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,042
supposed to be. They're also
called barking deer. That's how

12
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:44,542
they communicate with each other
and warn each other of any kind

13
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:47,046
of danger, which I think is kind
of cool.

14
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:48,748
Here you go, Chowlie girl.

15
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,214
Chowlie, she's going to be kind
of like the grandma of the

16
00:00:51,215 --> 00:00:55,003
bunch. She's an older female,
but she's experienced out there.

17
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:58,992
So I see her really kind of
taking the leadership role.

18
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:01,774
There's such a cute animal.
Everybody thinks they're babies,

19
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:04,670
they are not. Tyler and Peanut
are still doing a little bit of

20
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:07,143
growing, but for the most part,
they are a very small deer

21
00:01:07,144 --> 00:01:10,686
species. They're a year and two
years old. And they're just

22
00:01:10,687 --> 00:01:13,256
really fun. Everyone loves
Chowlie, so these two are just

23
00:01:13,257 --> 00:01:15,486
going to be a great addition to
our area.

24
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:23,729
This is our little makeshift
wall that we use a lot of times,

25
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,735
when we're doing introductions
with hoofstock. And it's solid,

26
00:01:26,736 --> 00:01:29,586
so the deer can see it. The
tough thing about muntjac, is

27
00:01:29,587 --> 00:01:33,743
they get wound up really easy.
I mean, they can overheat really

28
00:01:33,744 --> 00:01:37,356
quickly. It's actually pretty
frustrating, because sometimes

29
00:01:37,357 --> 00:01:39,642
you're like, just calm down,
it's not that big a deal. And

30
00:01:39,643 --> 00:01:42,700
it's really a small hoofstock,
a small ungulate thing. These

31
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:45,407
guys are food, so if there is
aggression, and we get some

32
00:01:45,408 --> 00:01:48,757
chasing and stuff like that, we
can quickly try to time that and

33
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:52,111
separate them, and stop that
aggression if that happens.

34
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,280
Let's get two more sheets.

35
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,115
Hi, cute deer.

36
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,500
So I've been at the zoo about 24
years. And one of the things I

37
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:04,090
love is, I really look at what
animals behaviors are.

38
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:08,862
Excuse me. Can we talk some
more?

39
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:12,843
I try very hard not to analyze
them and put my own impressions

40
00:02:12,844 --> 00:02:14,400
on them, but it's kind of hard
not to.

41
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,941
Hey. We've been talking all
night long. This is my formal

42
00:02:17,942 --> 00:02:20,273
greeting, I am Tyler.

43
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,510
It's just-- it geeks me out.

44
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,311
Easy.

45
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:26,112
I got it.

46
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:26,880
You're all right.

47
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:35,488
I think, yeah. I think they'll
be excited to be outside.

48
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,957
All right, good luck.

49
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:38,758
OK, ready?

50
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,548
We open the crates, and as soon
as we get them open, they, of

51
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:52,935
course, jump out and go pretty
quickly. They think they kind of

52
00:02:52,936 --> 00:02:55,709
realize, oh, we're outside, you
know. So then I think it kind of

53
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,278
calms down once they're out of
the crate.

54
00:02:58,343 --> 00:03:02,400
I like this tree, it's very
delicious. Quick, look at all

55
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:04,317
these grass.

56
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,552
Where is Chowlie?

57
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:08,221
Hope she gets up investigates.

58
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,623
Oh, there she is, OK.

59
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,460
Chowlie's still laying down, not
caring about anything.

60
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,266
Chowlie is just laying down
right now, so she hasn't really

61
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:20,371
gotten up. I'm sure she notices
something's going on, because

62
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:23,913
obviously, us coming in with
crates is not her norm. But

63
00:03:23,914 --> 00:03:26,271
right now, she's calm, she's
laying down, while they're kind

64
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,807
of investigating their area.

65
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,108
So you have some friends.

66
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,977
Yeah.

67
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,501
I think everything went well.
Hopefully those two will

68
00:03:33,502 --> 00:03:36,857
interact through the lattice,
and we'll see what they do, and

69
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:38,484
we'll continue tomorrow.
