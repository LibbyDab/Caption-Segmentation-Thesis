1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,383
Plastic. 12 million tons of it
end up in the ocean every year.

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,729
Each year, it's likely over half
a million animals are ensnared

3
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,586
and killed by these ghost nets.
But some animals are learning

4
00:00:27,587 --> 00:00:32,971
how to take advantage of the
plastic rafts... and use them

5
00:00:32,972 --> 00:00:36,840
for shelter or even as a home.

6
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:45,271
This male Columbus crab, barely
bigger than your thumbnail, is a

7
00:00:45,272 --> 00:00:50,914
castaway. Clinging to his net,
he may have been drifting on

8
00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:57,629
ocean currents for months. Now
fully grown, he needs to find a

9
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:03,786
partner. Columbus crabs are not
good swimmers. So this male is

10
00:01:03,787 --> 00:01:05,282
marooned.

11
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,243
Perhaps a passing loggerhead
turtle could be the chance to

12
00:01:12,244 --> 00:01:14,119
hitch a lift.

13
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:55,341
Made it. But there is more than
one passenger here -- a female

14
00:01:55,342 --> 00:01:56,714
Columbus Crab.

15
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,917
They waste no time
in getting aquainted.

16
00:02:08,114 --> 00:02:10,514
And start to mate.

17
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,233
This pair may well stay together
for the rest of their lives.

18
00:02:28,757 --> 00:02:35,829
The turtle, after all, makes an
excellent home. In return, the

19
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,917
crabs provide an onboard
grooming service.
