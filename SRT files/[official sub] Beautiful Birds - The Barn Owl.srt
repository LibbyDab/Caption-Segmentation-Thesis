1
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:18,930
The barn owl is unquestionably a beautiful
bird.

2
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,210
It has a distinctive heart-shaped face, mottled
brown and grey wings with pure white underparts.

3
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:31,029
They have a wingspan of around 80-95 cm and
weigh in at 250-350g.

4
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:36,420
It is considered to be one of Britain's most
popular birds and one of the more commonly

5
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,610
seen owls due to its readiness to hunt during
the day, although dusk is probably the best

6
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,870
time to see one.

7
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,320
They are silent hunters, tiny serrations on
the leading edges of their flight feathers

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,000
and a hairlike fringe on the trailing edges
help to break up the flow of air over the

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,809
wings and this reduces turbulence and the
noise it would cause.

10
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:03,370
The barn owl flies slowly while hunting and
will hover over spots where prey might be

11
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,370
hiding.

12
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:09,900
The barn owl has fantastic hearing with asymmetrical
ears which improves the owl's ability to pinpoint

13
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,390
the position and distance of sounds.

14
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,580
Their heart-shaped face also aids the owl's
ability to hear.

15
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,250
It's been shown that if the ruff feathers
are removed, the owl can still determine the

16
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,920
sounds position, but not its height.

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,659
Barn owls' main source of prey are rodents
and other small mammals, in fact, over 90%

18
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,120
of an owl's diet is made up of such animals.

19
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:40,670
But it will also prey upon other birds, lizards,
amphibians, fish, spiders, and insects.

20
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:46,710
The barn owl has a high metabolic rate, more
so than most other owls of a similar size.

21
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,719
This means it requires relatively more food.

22
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:54,000
Observations have shown that the barn owl
will eat around 14% of its own body weight

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,720
of rodents per night.

24
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:01,350
It may also store excess food at roosting
sites which it will return to if food is scarce.

25
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,940
Their high rate of rodent kills makes them
very valuable to farmers who wish to keep

26
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,250
the rodent population down.

27
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,010
Barn owls are said to be more effective than
poison for rodent control.

28
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,530
As their name suggests, barn owls will nest
in cavities of barns and old buildings as

29
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,060
well as hollows of trees.

30
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,550
Nests are built on top of the previous year's
nests.

31
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:27,540
There is no set breeding season for these
owls, and this largely depends on the available

32
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,890
food supply, but most commonly occurs between
March and August.

33
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,360
Around 4-6 eggs will be laid and up to 2 broods
will be raised in a year.

34
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,019
Barn owls are fairly common and be seen all
over Britain and Ireland, although populations

35
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,220
are under threat in Northern Ireland.

36
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,750
They did go through a dramatic population
decline all over Britain during the 1950s

37
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,379
and 60s, dipping down to as low as 4000 breeding
pairs.

38
00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:00,410
This was most likely due to the use of toxic
farm chemicals such as DDT, but also loss

39
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:09,050
of hunting habitat, and two particularly harsh
winters of 1946/47 and 1962/63.

40
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:15,600
Barn owls can also be susceptible to poisoning
by ingesting rodents killed by rodenticides.

41
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,180
Nesting sites are also scarce due to many
old barns and buildings being demolished or

42
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,180
renovated.

43
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,440
Luckily, population numbers are thought to
be on the rise due to improved conservation

44
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,870
efforts and many nest boxes being built.

45
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,319
These nest boxes have also allowed populations
of owls to inhabit areas that they previously

46
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,180
were absent from, such as the fens.

47
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,430
Although it seems the population is fairly
healthy, having increased to around 14,000

48
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:46,209
breeding pairs, it is acknowledged that monitoring
of nocturnal birds is difficult and population

49
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:49,950
studies are somewhat unreliable.

50
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,810
Barn owls have a typical lifespan of around
4 years, typically breeding at 1 year.

51
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,500
However, the oldest confirmed age by the British
Trust for Ornithology, was 15 years, 3 months,

52
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,780
and 21 days.

53
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,690
The barn owl is clearly a beautiful bird,
easy on the eyes you might say, but not so

54
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,600
easy on the ears.

55
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,740
Other names for this bird include 'screech
owl, and 'demon owl' which might give you

56
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:24,600
some idea as to what they sound like!

57
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,009
But this is the 'beautiful birds' series,
not 'beautiful sounding birds' series, so

58
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:30,889
its place is well deserved.

59
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:34,860
