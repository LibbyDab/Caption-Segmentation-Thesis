1
00:00:00,557 --> 00:00:03,886
The nest building is like a
miracle of nature, in my

2
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:05,299
opinion.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,060
(water rushing softly)

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,642
I didn't know that Zoom could
curl up her tail like that. Her

5
00:00:14,643 --> 00:00:19,800
grip needs to be strong
to hold onto that vegetation.

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,964
To see Zoom come out of the
water with her full load of

7
00:00:38,965 --> 00:00:45,448
nesting materials and then
disappear into a tiny burrow,

8
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:49,656
it's incredible. How does all
that stuff even fit in the

9
00:00:49,657 --> 00:00:53,870
burrow? The platypus can hardly
fit through that hole. She's

10
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:59,560
constructing that nest in 100%
darkness.

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,600
We were super fortunate to find
Zoom's burrow. So my strategy is

12
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:17,144
to place a number of trail
cameras around that burrow, out

13
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:21,643
of her way, and just leave them
running. When they see something

14
00:01:21,644 --> 00:01:24,520
happen, they'll send me an
alert.

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,637
When I woke up one morning and
looked at my phone I saw two or

16
00:01:34,638 --> 00:01:37,557
three alerts from the trail
cameras around that nesting

17
00:01:37,558 --> 00:01:45,728
burrow. It was like, something's
gone down. Easy. All right, the

18
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:46,930
moment of truth.

19
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:56,186
To see a youngster come out of
Zoom's burrow was such a magical

20
00:01:56,187 --> 00:01:56,957
feeling.

21
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,756
(laughing)

22
00:01:58,757 --> 00:02:02,036
And the next day I'd come down
to the pond here and I've just

23
00:02:02,236 --> 00:02:05,672
been walking around for a few
minutes looking for him. There's

24
00:02:05,872 --> 00:02:09,639
me walking around looking for
him everywhere, but the whole

25
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:11,857
time he'd been behind me.

26
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:17,000
(light music)
(water rushing softly)

27
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:30,243
Young platypus are so vulnerable
and so clumsy.

28
00:02:30,244 --> 00:02:32,557
(water splashing)

29
00:02:40,357 --> 00:02:46,621
But Zoom's work as a mother is
done. Now her baby's out of the

30
00:02:46,622 --> 00:02:50,180
burrow, he'll have to find his
own way in the world.

31
00:02:57,757 --> 00:03:01,328
(birds chittering)

32
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:05,371
Zoom's youngster gives me hope
that platypus can continue

33
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:07,000
living in this city.

34
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:36,760
(light music fades out)
