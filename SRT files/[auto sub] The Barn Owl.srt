1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,820
The barn owl is unquestionably
a beautiful bird.

2
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,220
It has a distinctive heart
-shaped face,

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,740
mottled brown and grey wings
with pure white underparts.

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,000
They have a wingspan of around

5
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:31,600
80-95 cm and weigh
in at 250-350g.

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,240
It is considered to be one

7
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,600
of Britain's most popular birds
and one of the more commonly

8
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,940
seen owls due to its readiness
to hunt during the day,

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,340
although dusk is probably
the best time to see one.

10
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,900
They are silent hunters,

11
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,300
tiny serrations on the leading
edges of their flight feathers

12
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,160
and a hairlike fringe
on the trailing edges help

13
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,560
to break up the flow of air over
the wings and this reduces

14
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,780
turbulence and the noise
it would cause.

15
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,880
The barn owl flies slowly while
hunting and will hover over

16
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,290
spots where prey
might be hiding.

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,930
The barn owl has fantastic

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,120
hearing with asymmetrical ears
which improves the owl's ability

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,660
to pinpoint the position
and distance of sounds.

20
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,460
Their heart-shaped face also
aids the owl's ability to hear.

21
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,840
It's been shown that if the ruff

22
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,320
feathers are removed,
the owl can still determine

23
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,343
the sounds position,
but not its height.

24
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,200
Barn owls' main source of prey

25
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,820
are rodents and other small
mammals, in fact,

26
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,620
over 90% of an owl's diet
is made up of such animals.

27
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,480
But it will also prey upon other

28
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:40,490
birds, lizards, amphibians,
fish, spiders, and insects.

29
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,180
The barn owl has a high
metabolic rate,

30
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,570
more so than most other
owls of a similar size.

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,780
This means it requires
relatively more food.

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Observations have shown
that the barn owl will eat

33
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,780
around 14% of its own body
weight of rodents per night.

34
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,720
It may also store excess food

35
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,850
at roosting sites which it will
return to if food is scarce.

36
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,440
Their high rate of rodent kills
makes them very valuable

37
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,020
to farmers who wish to keep
the rodent population down.

38
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,386
Barn owls are said to be more

39
00:02:09,387 --> 00:02:12,580
effective than poison
for rodent control.

40
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,560
As their name suggests,
barn owls will nest in cavities

41
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,780
of barns and old buildings
as well as hollows of trees.

42
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,500
Nests are built on top
of the previous year's nests.

43
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,660
There is no set breeding season
for these owls,

44
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,170
and this largely depends
on the available food supply,

45
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,730
but most commonly occurs
between March and August.

46
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,500
Around 4-6 eggs will be laid

47
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,220
and up to 2 broods will
be raised in a year.

48
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,680
Barn owls are fairly common

49
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,060
and be seen all over Britain
and Ireland,

50
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,610
although populations are under
threat in Northern Ireland.

51
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,420
They did go through a dramatic

52
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,560
population decline all over
Britain during the 1950s

53
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,260
and 60s, dipping down to as
low as 4000 breeding pairs.

54
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,400
This was most likely due

55
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,540
to the use of toxic farm
chemicals such as DDT,

56
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,240
but also loss of hunting
habitat, and two particularly

57
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:08,820
harsh winters of 1946
/47 and 1962/63.

58
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,200
Barn owls can also be
susceptible to poisoning

59
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,100
by ingesting rodents
killed by rodenticides.

60
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,700
Nesting sites are also scarce
due to many old barns

61
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,900
and buildings being
demolished or renovated.

62
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,440
Luckily, population numbers are
thought to be on the rise due

63
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,700
to improved conservation efforts
and many nest boxes being built.

64
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,680
These nest boxes have also

65
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,920
allowed populations of owls
to inhabit areas that they

66
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,100
previously were absent from,
such as the fens.

67
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,440
Although it seems the population

68
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,200
is fairly healthy,
having increased to around 14

69
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,960
,000 breeding pairs,
it is acknowledged

70
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,580
that monitoring of nocturnal
birds is difficult

71
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,740
and population studies
are somewhat unreliable.

72
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,640
Barn owls have a typical

73
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,820
lifespan of around 4 years,
typically breeding at 1 year.

74
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,580
However, the oldest confirmed
age by the British Trust

75
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,660
for Ornithology, was 15 years,
3 months, and 21 days.

76
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,420
The barn owl is clearly
a beautiful bird,

77
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,420
easy on the eyes you might say,
but not so easy on the ears.

78
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,680
Other names for this bird

79
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,840
include 'screech owl,
and 'demon owl' which might give

80
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,300
you some idea as to what
they sound like!

81
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,240
But this is the 'beautiful birds

82
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,280
' series,
not 'beautiful sounding birds'

83
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,820
series, so its place
is well deserved.

84
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:32,771
Thank you for watching this

85
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,260

88
