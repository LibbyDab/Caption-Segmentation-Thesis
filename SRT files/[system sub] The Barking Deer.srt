1
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:06,706
Can you move out of the way,
though?

2
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:09,743
You gotta move over here, sir.

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,612
OK, thank you.

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,714
Hey.

5
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,517
How you guys doing, huh?

6
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:18,752
Today
we're going to be introducing

7
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:22,222
our two new muntjac,
Tyler and Peanut, to Chowlie.

8
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,324
Muntjac are
a small Asian species.

9
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,192
What I like about them is,
they like to hide,

10
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,228
and they're very, very sneaky.

11
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:30,964
They actually were introduced
also, in England,

12
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,832
and they're kind of a nuisance
in England.

13
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,002
I just find it very interesting
that an animal from Asia

14
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,771
was introduced into an area
where they're

15
00:00:38,814 --> 00:00:40,306
not supposed to be.

16
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,608
They're also called barking
deer.

17
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,042
That's how they
communicate with each other

18
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,211
and warn each other of any kind
of danger,

19
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,046
which I think is kind of cool.

20
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:48,748
Here you go, Chowlie girl.

21
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:49,929
Chowlie,
she's going to be kind of

22
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:52,218
like the grandma of the bunch.

23
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,854
She's an older female,
but she's experienced out there.

24
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:58,992
So I see her really kind
of taking the leadership role.

25
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:00,360
There's such a cute animal.

26
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,362
Everybody thinks they're babies,
they are not.

27
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,898
Tyler and Peanut are still doing
a little bit of growing,

28
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,288
but for the most part,
they are a very small deer

29
00:01:07,289 --> 00:01:07,667
species.

30
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,036
They're a year and two years
old.

31
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,200
And they're just really fun.

32
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:12,915
Everyone loves Chowlie,
so these two are

33
00:01:12,943 --> 00:01:15,629
just going to be
a great addition to our area.

34
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,415
This is
our little makeshift wall

35
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,894
that we use a lot of times,
when we're doing introductions

36
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:25,518
with hoofstock.

37
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,921
And it's solid,
so the deer can see it.

38
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,600
The tough thing about muntjac,
is they get wound up

39
00:01:30,643 --> 00:01:31,257
really easy.

40
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,271
I mean,
they can overheat

41
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,661
really quickly.

42
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,196
It's
actually pretty frustrating,

43
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,064
because sometimes you're like,
just calm down,

44
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,065
it's not that big a deal.

45
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,934
And it's really
a small hoofstock,

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,435
a small ungulate thing.

47
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,804
These guys are food,
so if there is aggression,

48
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,439
and we get some chasing
and stuff like that,

49
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,586
we can quickly try to time
that and separate them,

50
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:52,111
and stop that aggression
if that happens.

51
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,280
Let's get two more sheets.

52
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,115
Hi, cute deer.

53
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:57,884
So I've been at the zoo about 24
years.

54
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:02,255
And one of the things I love is,
I really look at what animals

55
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,090
behaviors are.

56
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,025
Excuse me.

57
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,862
Can we talk some more?

58
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:12,286
I try very hard not
to analyze them and put my

59
00:02:12,314 --> 00:02:14,343
own impressions on them,
but it's kind of hard not to.

60
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:15,635
Hey.

61
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,237
We've been talking all night
long.

62
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,273
This is my formal greeting,
I am Tyler.

63
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,510
It's just-- it geeks me out.

64
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,311
Easy.

65
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:26,112
I got it.

66
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:26,880
You're all right.

67
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:29,949
I think, yeah.

68
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,488
I think they'll be excited
to be outside.

69
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,957
All right, good luck.

70
00:02:38,029 --> 00:02:38,757
OK, ready?

71
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:48,701
We open the crates,
and as soon as we get them open,

72
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:51,604
they, of course,
jump out and go pretty quickly.

73
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,607
They think they kind of realize,
oh, we're outside, you know.

74
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,543
So then I think it kind of calms
down once they're

75
00:02:56,571 --> 00:02:57,814
out of the crate.

76
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,514
I like this tree,
it's very delicious.

77
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,317
Quick, look at all these grass.

78
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,552
Where is Chowlie?

79
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:08,221
Hope she gets up investigates.

80
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,623
Oh, there she is, OK.

81
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,460
Chowlie's still laying down,
not caring about anything.

82
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,129
Chowlie is just laying down
right now,

83
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,730
so she hasn't really gotten up.

84
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,147
I'm sure she notices
something's going on,

85
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:22,743
because obviously,
us coming in with crates is not

86
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:23,503
her norm.

87
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,471
But right now, she's calm,
she's laying down,

88
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,214
while they're
kind of investigating their

89
00:03:27,243 --> 00:03:27,807
area.

90
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,108
So you have some friends.

91
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,977
Yeah.

92
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,245
I think everything went well.

93
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,683
Hopefully those two
will interact

94
00:03:33,883 --> 00:03:36,400
through the lattice,
and we'll see what they do,

95
00:03:36,443 --> 00:03:38,484
and we'll continue tomorrow.
