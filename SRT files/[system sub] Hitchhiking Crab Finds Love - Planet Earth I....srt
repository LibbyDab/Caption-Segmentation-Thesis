1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,560
Plastic.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,383
12 million tons of it end up
in the ocean every year.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,160
Each year,
it's likely over half a million

4
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:24,920
animals are ensnared and killed
by these ghost nets.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,900
But some animals are learning
how

6
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:31,317
to take advantage of the plastic
rafts...

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,840
and use them for shelter or even
as a home.

8
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:43,114
This male Columbus crab,
barely bigger than your

9
00:00:43,115 --> 00:00:47,000
thumbnail, is a castaway.

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,714
Clinging to his net,
he may have been drifting

11
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:53,880
on ocean currents for months.

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,240
Now fully grown,
he needs to find a partner.

13
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,540
Columbus crabs are
not good swimmers.

14
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,986
So this male is marooned.

15
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,071
Perhaps a passing loggerhead
turtle could be the chance

16
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,429
to hitch a lift.

17
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,040
Made it.

18
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,429
But there is more than one
passenger here --

19
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,671
a female Columbus Crab.

20
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,440
They waste no time
in getting aquainted.

21
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,314
And start to mate.

22
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,610
This pair may well stay together
for the rest of their lives.

23
00:02:28,529 --> 00:02:33,680
The turtle, after all,
makes an excellent home.

24
00:02:34,843 --> 00:02:36,960
In return,
the crabs provide

25
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:39,829
an onboard grooming service.
