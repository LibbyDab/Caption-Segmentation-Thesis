1
00:00:00,557 --> 00:00:03,557
The nest building is
like a miracle of nature,

2
00:00:03,558 --> 00:00:04,730
in my opinion.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,060
(water rushing softly)

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,940
I didn't know that Zoom could
curl up her tail like that.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:19,800
Her grip needs to be strong
to hold onto that vegetation.

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,757
To see Zoom come out of the
water with her full load

7
00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:42,670
of nesting materials
and then disappear

8
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:47,420
into a tiny burrow,
it's incredible.

9
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,200
How does all that stuff
even fit in the burrow?

10
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,820
The platypus can hardly
fit through that hole.

11
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:59,560
She's constructing that
nest in 100% darkness.

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,570
We were super fortunate
to find Zoom's burrow.

13
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,600
So my strategy is
to place a number

14
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:16,886
of trail cameras
around that burrow,

15
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:20,570
out of her way, and
just leave them running.

16
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,520
When they see something happen,
they'll send me an alert.

17
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,943
When I woke up one morning
and looked at my phone

18
00:01:33,944 --> 00:01:35,331
I saw two or three alerts

19
00:01:35,332 --> 00:01:37,980
from the trail cameras
around that nesting burrow.

20
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,620
It was like,
something's gone down.

21
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,820
Easy.

22
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,930
All right, the moment of truth.

23
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:53,271
To see a youngster come out

24
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:56,957
of Zoom's burrow was
such a magical feeling.

25
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,756
(laughing)

26
00:01:58,757 --> 00:02:00,924
And the next day I'd come down

27
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:03,057
to the pond here and I've
just been walking around

28
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:05,210
for a few minutes
looking for him.

29
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,450
There's me walking around
looking for him everywhere,

30
00:02:08,486 --> 00:02:11,857
but the whole time
he'd been behind me.

31
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:17,000
(light music)
(water rushing softly)

32
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:24,843
Young platypus are so vulnerable

33
00:02:28,157 --> 00:02:30,243
and so clumsy.

34
00:02:30,244 --> 00:02:32,557
(water splashing)

35
00:02:40,357 --> 00:02:43,871
But Zoom's work as
a mother is done.

36
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:47,328
Now her baby's
out of the burrow,

37
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:50,180
he'll have to find his
own way in the world.

38
00:02:57,757 --> 00:03:01,328
(birds chittering)

39
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:03,489
Zoom's youngster gives me hope

40
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,000
that platypus can continue
living in this city.

41
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:36,760
(light music fades out)
