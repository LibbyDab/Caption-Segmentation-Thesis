1
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:06,706
Can you move out
of the way, though?

2
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:09,743
You gotta move over here, sir.

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,612
OK, thank you.

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,714
Hey.

5
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,517
How you guys doing, huh?

6
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:18,752
Today we're going
to be introducing

7
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:22,222
our two new muntjac, Tyler
and Peanut, to Chowlie.

8
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,324
Muntjac are a
small Asian species.

9
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,192
What I like about them
is, they like to hide,

10
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,228
and they're very, very sneaky.

11
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:30,964
They actually were
introduced also, in England,

12
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,832
and they're kind of a
nuisance in England.

13
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,002
I just find it very interesting
that an animal from Asia

14
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,571
was introduced
into an area where

15
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,306
they're not supposed to be.

16
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,608
They're also called
barking deer.

17
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,042
That's how they
communicate with each other

18
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,211
and warn each other
of any kind of danger,

19
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,046
which I think is kind of cool.

20
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:48,748
Here you go, Chowlie girl.

21
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,917
Chowlie, she's going to
be kind of like the grandma

22
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,218
of the bunch.

23
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,854
She's an older female, but
she's experienced out there.

24
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:58,992
So I see her really kind of
taking the leadership role.

25
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:00,360
There's such a cute animal.

26
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,362
Everybody thinks they're
babies, they are not.

27
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,898
Tyler and Peanut are still
doing a little bit of growing,

28
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,667
but for the most part, they
are a very small deer species.

29
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,036
They're a year
and two years old.

30
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,371
And they're just really fun.

31
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,506
Everyone loves Chowlie, so
these two are just going to be

32
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,974
a great addition to our area.

33
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,415
This is our little
makeshift wall

34
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,184
that we use a lot of
times, when we're doing

35
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,518
introductions with hoofstock.

36
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,921
And it's solid, so
the deer can see it.

37
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,589
The tough thing
about muntjac, is

38
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,257
they get wound up really easy.

39
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:34,661
I mean, they can
overheat really quickly.

40
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,196
It's actually
pretty frustrating,

41
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,064
because sometimes you're
like, just calm down,

42
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,065
it's not that big a deal.

43
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,934
And it's really a
small hoofstock,

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,435
a small ungulate thing.

45
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,804
These guys are food, so
if there is aggression,

46
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,439
and we get some chasing
and stuff like that,

47
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,075
we can quickly try to
time that and separate

48
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:52,111
them, and stop that
aggression if that happens.

49
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,280
Let's get two more sheets.

50
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,115
Hi, cute deer.

51
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:57,884
So I've been at the
zoo about 24 years.

52
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:02,255
And one of the things I love is,
I really look at what animals

53
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,090
behaviors are.

54
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,025
Excuse me.

55
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,862
Can we talk some more?

56
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:11,431
I try very hard
not to analyze them

57
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,600
and put my own impressions on
them, but it's kind of hard

58
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,400
not to.

59
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,635
Hey.

60
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,237
We've been talking
all night long.

61
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,273
This is my formal
greeting, I am Tyler.

62
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,510
It's just-- it geeks me out.

63
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,311
Easy.

64
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:26,112
I got it.

65
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:26,880
You're all right.

66
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:29,949
I think, yeah.

67
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,488
I think they'll be
excited to be outside.

68
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,957
All right, good luck.

69
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:38,758
OK, ready?

70
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,701
We open the crates, and
as soon as we get them open,

71
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:51,604
they, of course, jump out
and go pretty quickly.

72
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,607
They think they kind of realize,
oh, we're outside, you know.

73
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,142
So then I think it
kind of calms down

74
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,278
once they're out of the crate.

75
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,514
I like this tree,
it's very delicious.

76
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,317
Quick, look at all these grass.

77
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,552
Where is Chowlie?

78
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:08,221
Hope she gets up investigates.

79
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,623
Oh, there she is, OK.

80
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,460
Chowlie's still laying down,
not caring about anything.

81
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,129
Chowlie is just
laying down right now,

82
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,730
so she hasn't really gotten up.

83
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,532
I'm sure she notices
something's going

84
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,503
on, because obviously, us coming
in with crates is not her norm.

85
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,471
But right now, she's
calm, she's laying down,

86
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,807
while they're kind of
investigating their area.

87
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,108
So you have some friends.

88
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,977
Yeah.

89
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,245
I think everything went well.

90
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,514
Hopefully those two will
interact through the lattice,

91
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:38,484
and we'll see what they do,
and we'll continue tomorrow.
