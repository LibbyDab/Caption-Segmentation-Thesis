1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,240
The nest building is like

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,730
a miracle of nature,
in my opinion.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,060
(water rushing softly)

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,940
I didn't know that Zoom could
curl up her tail like that.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:19,800
Her grip needs to be strong
to hold onto that vegetation.

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,440
To see Zoom come out

7
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,900
of the water with her full load
of nesting materials

8
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:47,420
and then disappear into a tiny
burrow, it's incredible.

9
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,200
How does all that stuff
even fit in the burrow?

10
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,820
The platypus can hardly
fit through that hole.

11
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:59,560
She's constructing that nest
in 100% darkness.

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,570
We were super fortunate
to find Zoom's burrow.

13
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,280
So my strategy is to place
a number of trail cameras around

14
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,570
that burrow, out of her way,
and just leave them running.

15
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,520
When they see something happen,
they'll send me an alert.

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,600
When I woke up one morning

17
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,040
and looked at my phone I saw two
or three alerts from the trail

18
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,980
cameras around
that nesting burrow.

19
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,620
It was like,
something's gone down.

20
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,820
Easy.

21
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,930
All right, the moment of truth.

22
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,800
To
see a youngster come out of Zoom

23
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,660
's burrow was such
a magical feeling.

24
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,100
(laughing)

25
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,320
And the next day I'd come down
to the pond here and I've just

26
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,210
been walking around for a few
minutes looking for him.

27
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,450
There's me walking around
looking for him everywhere,

28
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,860
but the whole time
he'd been behind me.

29
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,200
(light music)

30
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,780
(water rushing softly)

31
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:30,660
Young platypus are so vulnerable
and so clumsy.

32
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:39,980
(water splashing)

33
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,420
But Zoom's work as
a mother is done.

34
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,040
Now her baby's out

35
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:50,180
of the burrow, he'll have to
find his own way in the world.

36
00:02:50,210 --> 00:03:00,940
(birds chittering)

37
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,460
Zoom's youngster gives me hope

38
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,320
that platypus can continue
living in this city.

39
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:36,760
(light music fades out)
