1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,586
The nest building is
like a miracle of nature,

2
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:04,730
in my opinion.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,528
(water rushing softly)

4
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:12,614
I didn't know that Zoom
could curl up her tail

5
00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:13,940
like that.

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:19,800
Her grip needs to be strong
to hold onto that vegetation.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,529
To see Zoom come
out of the water

8
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,985
with her full load
of nesting materials

9
00:00:40,986 --> 00:00:47,420
and then disappear into a tiny
burrow, it's incredible.

10
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,200
How does all that stuff even fit
in the burrow?

11
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,820
The platypus can hardly fit
through that hole.

12
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:59,560
She's constructing that nest
in 100% darkness.

13
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,570
We were super fortunate
to find Zoom's burrow.

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,821
So my strategy
is to place a number

15
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:16,929
of trail cameras
around that burrow,

16
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,570
out of her way,
and just leave them running.

17
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,520
When they see something happen,
they'll send me an alert.

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,213
When I woke up one morning
and looked at my phone I saw

19
00:01:34,214 --> 00:01:36,576
two or three alerts
from the trail cameras

20
00:01:36,577 --> 00:01:37,980
around that nesting burrow.

21
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,620
It was like,
something's gone down.

22
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,820
Easy.

23
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,930
All right, the moment of truth.

24
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:54,485
To see a youngster come
out of Zoom's burrow was

25
00:01:54,486 --> 00:01:56,971
such a magical feeling.

26
00:01:56,972 --> 00:01:58,385
(laughing)

27
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,857
And the next day I'd come down
to the pond here and I've

28
00:02:01,858 --> 00:02:04,486
just been walking around
for a few minutes looking

29
00:02:04,487 --> 00:02:05,210
for him.

30
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,743
There's me walking
around looking for him

31
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,286
everywhere,
but the whole time he'd been

32
00:02:10,287 --> 00:02:11,671
behind me.

33
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:18,199
(light music)

34
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,300
(water rushing softly)

35
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:30,660
Young platypus are so vulnerable
and so clumsy.

36
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:39,980
(water splashing)

37
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,714
But Zoom's work as a mother
is done.

38
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,356
Now her baby's
out of the burrow,

39
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:50,180
he'll have to find his own way
in the world.

40
00:02:50,210 --> 00:03:00,940
(birds chittering)

41
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,313
Zoom's youngster gives me hope
that platypus

42
00:03:04,314 --> 00:03:07,271
can continue living
in this city.

43
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:36,760
(light music fades out)
