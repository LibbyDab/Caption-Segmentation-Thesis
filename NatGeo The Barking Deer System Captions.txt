1
Can you move out of the way,
though?

2
You gotta move over here, sir.

3
OK, thank you.

4
Hey.

5
How you guys doing, huh?

6
Today
we're going to be introducing

7
our two new muntjac,
Tyler and Peanut, to Chowlie.

8
Muntjac
are a small Asian species.

9
What I like about them is,
they like to hide,

10
and they're very, very sneaky.

11
They
actually were introduced also,

12
in England,
and they're kind of a nuisance

13
in England.

14
I just find it very interesting
that an animal from Asia

15
was introduced into an area
where

16
they're not supposed to be.

17
They're also called barking
deer.

18
That's how they
communicate with each other

19
and warn each other
of any kind of danger,

20
which I think is kind of cool.

21
Here you go, Chowlie girl.

22
Chowlie,
she's going to be kind of

23
like the grandma of the bunch.

24
She's an older female,
but she's experienced out there.

25
So I see her really kind
of taking the leadership role.

26
There's such a cute animal.

27
Everybody thinks they're babies,
they are not.

28
Tyler and Peanut are still doing
a little bit of growing,

29
but for the most part,
they

30
are a very small deer species.

31
They're
a year and two years old.

32
And they're just really fun.

33
Everyone loves Chowlie,
so these two

34
are just going to be
a great addition to our area.

35
This is
our little makeshift wall

36
that we use a lot of times,
when we're doing introductions

37
with hoofstock.

38
And it's solid,
so the deer can see it.

39
The tough thing about muntjac,
is

40
they get wound up really easy.

41
I mean,
they

42
can overheat really quickly.

43
It's actually
pretty frustrating,

44
because sometimes you're like,
just calm down,

45
it's not that big a deal.

46
And it's really
a small hoofstock,

47
a small ungulate thing.

48
These guys are food,
so if there is aggression,

49
and we get
some chasing and stuff

50
like that,
we can quickly try to time

51
that and separate them,
and stop that aggression

52
if that happens.

53
Let's get two more sheets.

54
Hi, cute deer.

55
So I've been at the zoo
about 24 years.

56
And one of the things I love is,
I really look

57
at what animals behaviors are.

58
Excuse me.

59
Can we talk some more?

60
I try very hard not
to analyze them

61
and put my own impressions
on them,

62
but it's kind of hard not to.

63
Hey.

64
We've been talking all night
long.

65
This is my formal greeting,
I am Tyler.

66
It's just-- it geeks me out.

67
Easy.

68
I got it.

69
You're all right.

70
I think, yeah.

71
I think they'll be
excited to be outside.

72
All right, good luck.

73
OK, ready?

74
We open the crates,
and as soon as we get them open,

75
they, of course,
jump out and go pretty quickly.

76
They think they kind of realize,
oh, we're outside, you know.

77
So then I think it
kind of calms down

78
once they're out of the crate.

79
I like this tree,
it's very delicious.

80
Quick, look at all these grass.

81
Where is Chowlie?

82
Hope she gets up investigates.

83
Oh, there she is, OK.

84
Chowlie's still laying down,
not caring about anything.

85
Chowlie
is just laying down right now,

86
so she hasn't really gotten up.

87
I'm sure she
notices something's going on,

88
because obviously,
us coming in with crates

89
is not her norm.

90
But right now, she's calm,
she's laying down,

91
while they're kind of
investigating their area.

92
So you have some friends.

93
Yeah.

94
I think everything went well.

95
Hopefully those two
will interact

96
through the lattice,
and we'll see what they do,

97
and we'll continue tomorrow.
