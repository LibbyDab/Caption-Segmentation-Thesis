1
Can you move out of the way,
though?

2
You gotta move over here, sir.

3
OK, thank you.

4
Hey.

5
How you guys doing, huh?

6
Today
we're going to be introducing

7
our two new muntjac,
Tyler and Peanut, to Chowlie.

8
Muntjac are
a small Asian species.

9
What I like about them is,
they like to hide,

10
and they're very, very sneaky.

11
They actually were introduced
also, in England,

12
and they're kind of a nuisance
in England.

13
I just find it very interesting
that an animal from Asia

14
was introduced into an area
where they're

15
not supposed to be.

16
They're also called barking
deer.

17
That's how they
communicate with each other

18
and warn each other of any kind
of danger,

19
which I think is kind of cool.

20
Here you go, Chowlie girl.

21
Chowlie,
she's going to be kind of

22
like the grandma of the bunch.

23
She's an older female,
but she's experienced out there.

24
So I see her really kind
of taking the leadership role.

25
There's such a cute animal.

26
Everybody thinks they're babies,
they are not.

27
Tyler and Peanut are still doing
a little bit of growing,

28
but for the most part,
they are a very small deer

29
species.

30
They're a year and two years
old.

31
And they're just really fun.

32
Everyone loves Chowlie,
so these two are

33
just going to be
a great addition to our area.

34
This is
our little makeshift wall

35
that we use a lot of times,
when we're doing introductions

36
with hoofstock.

37
And it's solid,
so the deer can see it.

38
The tough thing about muntjac,
is they get wound up

39
really easy.

40
I mean,
they can overheat

41
really quickly.

42
It's
actually pretty frustrating,

43
because sometimes you're like,
just calm down,

44
it's not that big a deal.

45
And it's really
a small hoofstock,

46
a small ungulate thing.

47
These guys are food,
so if there is aggression,

48
and we get some chasing
and stuff like that,

49
we can quickly try to time
that and separate them,

50
and stop that aggression
if that happens.

51
Let's get two more sheets.

52
Hi, cute deer.

53
So I've been at the zoo about 24
years.

54
And one of the things I love is,
I really look at what animals

55
behaviors are.

56
Excuse me.

57
Can we talk some more?

58
I try very hard not
to analyze them and put my

59
own impressions on them,
but it's kind of hard not to.

60
Hey.

61
We've been talking all night
long.

62
This is my formal greeting,
I am Tyler.

63
It's just-- it geeks me out.

64
Easy.

65
I got it.

66
You're all right.

67
I think, yeah.

68
I think they'll be excited
to be outside.

69
All right, good luck.

70
OK, ready?

71
We open the crates,
and as soon as we get them open,

72
they, of course,
jump out and go pretty quickly.

73
They think they kind of realize,
oh, we're outside, you know.

74
So then I think it kind of calms
down once they're

75
out of the crate.

76
I like this tree,
it's very delicious.

77
Quick, look at all these grass.

78
Where is Chowlie?

79
Hope she gets up investigates.

80
Oh, there she is, OK.

81
Chowlie's still laying down,
not caring about anything.

82
Chowlie is just laying down
right now,

83
so she hasn't really gotten up.

84
I'm sure she notices
something's going on,

85
because obviously,
us coming in with crates is not

86
her norm.

87
But right now, she's calm,
she's laying down,

88
while they're
kind of investigating their

89
area.

90
So you have some friends.

91
Yeah.

92
I think everything went well.

93
Hopefully those two
will interact

94
through the lattice,
and we'll see what they do,

95
and we'll continue tomorrow.
