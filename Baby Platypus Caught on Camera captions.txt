The nest building 17
is like a miracle of nature, 28

in my opinion. 14

(water rushing softly) 22

I didn't know that Zoom could 29
curl up her tail like that. 27

Her grip needs to be strong 27
to hold onto that vegetation. 29

To see Zoom 11
come out of the water 21

with her full load 18
of nesting materials 20

and then disappear into a tiny 30
burrow, 7

it's incredible. 16

How does all that stuff even fit 32
in the burrow? 14

The platypus can hardly fit 27
through that hole. 18

She's constructing that nest 28
in 100% darkness. 17

We were super fortunate to find 31
Zoom's burrow. 14

So my strategy is to place 26
a number of trail cameras 25

around that burrow, 19
out of her way, 15

and just leave them running. 28

When they see something happen, 31
they'll send me an alert. 25

When I woke up one morning 26
and looked at my phone 22

I saw two or three alerts 25
from the trail cameras 22

around that nesting burrow. 27

It was like, 12
something's gone down. 22

Easy. 5

All right, the moment of truth. 31

To see a youngster 18
come out of Zoom's burrow was 29

such a magical feeling. 23

(laughing) 10

And the next day 16
I'd come down to the pond here 30

and I've just been 18
walking around for a few minutes 32

looking for him. 16

There's me walking 18
around looking for him 22

everywhere, 11
but the whole time he'd been 28

behind me. 10

(light music) 13

(water rushing softly) 22

Young platypus are so vulnerable 32
and so clumsy. 14

(water splashing) 17

But Zoom's work as a mother is 30
done. 5

Now 3
her baby's out of the burrow, 29

he'll have to find his own way 30
in the world. 13

(birds chittering) 18

Zoom's youngster gives me hope 30
that platypus can continue 26

living in this city. 20

(light music fades out) 23
