The nest building is
like a miracle of nature,

2

in my opinion.

3

(water rushing softly)

4

I didn't know that Zoom
could curl up her tail

5

like that.

6

Her grip needs to be strong
to hold onto that vegetation.

7

To see Zoom come
out of the water

8

with her full load
of nesting materials

9

and then disappear into a tiny
burrow, it's incredible.

10

How does all that stuff even fit
in the burrow?

11

The platypus can hardly fit
through that hole.

12

She's constructing that nest
in 100% darkness.

13

We were super fortunate
to find Zoom's burrow.

14

So my strategy is
to place a number

15

of trail cameras
around that burrow,

16

out of her way,
and just leave them running.

17

When they see something happen,
they'll send me an alert.

18

When I woke up one morning
and looked at my phone I saw

19

two or three alerts
from the trail cameras

20

around that nesting burrow.

21

It was like,
something's gone down.

22

Easy.

23

All right, the moment of truth.

24

To see a youngster come
out of Zoom's burrow was

25

such a magical feeling.

26

(laughing)

27

And the next day I'd come down
to the pond here and I've

28

just been walking around
for a few minutes looking

29

for him.

30

There's me walking
around looking for him

31

everywhere,
but the whole time he'd been

32

behind me.

33

(light music)

34

(water rushing softly)

35

Young platypus are so vulnerable
and so clumsy.

36

(water splashing)

37

But Zoom's work as a mother
is done.

38

Now her baby's
out of the burrow,

39

he'll have to find his own way
in the world.

40

(birds chittering)

41

Zoom's youngster gives me hope
that platypus

42

can continue living
in this city.

43

(light music fades out)
